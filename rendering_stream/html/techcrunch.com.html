href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-buys-slack\/\"&gt;Salesforce-Slack deal was officially announced&lt;\/a&gt; on Tuesday afternoon, and the number appeared, it was kind of hard to believe. &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/salesforce\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"salesforce\"&gt;Salesforce &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; had shelled out more than $27 billion to buy Slack and bring it into the Salesforce family of products. The company sees a key missing piece in &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/slack\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"slack\"&gt;Slack, &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; and that could explain why it was willing to spend such an astonishing amount of money to get it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Slack, Salesforce now has what CEO Marc Benioff called the interface to everything, something he says that the company has thought about for years. In 2010, they tried building it themselves with Chatter, a social tool that never really caught on in a big way. With Slack they finally have it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve always had the vision of the social enterprise at Salesforce for more than a decade. Oh, we&amp;#8217;ve had Dreamforces entirely dedicated to the vision of what a collaborative interface, a high production interface with applications and an ecosystem would look like wrapped on top of our Customer 360,&amp;#8221; Benioff said.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He added that ironically in a building right next door to Salesforce Park you&amp;#8217;ll find Slack headquarters. They won&amp;#8217;t have to go far to collaborate (or you know, they can just use Slack).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;From Chatter to Slack&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures, says that Benioff has had an interest in enterprise social going back years, and this is his way of finally delivering. &amp;#8220;Remember Chatter? Benioff was dead on with this trend. He &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/06\/25\/its-official-microsoft-confirms-it-has-acquired-yammer-for-1-2-billion-in-cash\/\"&gt;lost Yammer to Microsoft&lt;\/a&gt; (when Microsoft acquired it for $1.2 billion) about 7-8 years ago, and then launched Chatter. It was a huge bet, but didn\u2019t work. Slack is really Chatter 2.0,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck Ganapathi, CEO and co-founder at Tact.ai, was product lead on the Chatter product at Salesforce in the 2009 time frame. He wrote in a soon-to-be-published blog post he shared with TechCrunch that it failed for a lot of reasons, but mostly because at its core, Salesforce was still a bunch of database guys and enterprise social was a very different animal.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"G3E7rVS2Z3\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/30\/as-slack-acquisition-rumors-swirl-a-look-at-salesforces-six-biggest-deals\/\"&gt;As Slack acquisition rumors swirl, a look at Salesforce&amp;#8217;s six biggest deals&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;As Slack acquisition rumors swirl, a look at Salesforce&amp;#8217;s six biggest deals&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/30\/as-slack-acquisition-rumors-swirl-a-look-at-salesforces-six-biggest-deals\/embed\/#?secret=G3E7rVS2Z3\" data-secret=\"G3E7rVS2Z3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Some of the issues were technical &amp;#8212; Salesforce is a database-centric company, founded by Oracle alums on a relational DB foundation. DB applications and unstructured communication applications like Chatter or Slack represent completely different branches of computer science with little overlap,&amp;#8221; he wrote. Because of that, he felt that they lacked the expertise to build the application correctly, and it never really caught on, with so many similar products in the market at the time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But Benioff never lost interest in the concept of incorporating social into the Salesforce platform. It just took another 10 years or so and a bushel of money to make it happen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;A good match or not?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leyla Seka, a partner at Operator Capital, who formerly ran the AppExchange at Salesforce, sees good things ahead with a combined Slack and Salesforce. &amp;#8220;Salesforce and Slack together will offer a powerful duo of applications that will help companies work more effectively together. I think that COVID-19 has shown us how critical it is to get employees the data they need to do their job, but also the community they need to thrive at their job. The marriage of Salesforce and Slack promises to do just that,&amp;#8221; Seka told me.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Be8IVr1LHF\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud\/\"&gt;With Hyperforce, Salesforce lets you move your data to any public cloud&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;With Hyperforce, Salesforce lets you move your data to any public cloud&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud\/embed\/#?secret=Be8IVr1LHF\" data-secret=\"Be8IVr1LHF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, was knocked out by the price tag, but says it shows that Salesforce is not afraid to go after what it wants, even if it has to pay a hefty price to get it. &amp;#8220;This goes to show Salesforce has absolutely no fear in them when it comes to this deal. They are willing to throw down the big bucks on this acquisition because they see a huge payoff by adding this piece into their platform,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for Slack, he sees it as a way for them to take the fast track to the enterprise big leagues. &amp;#8220;And for Slack they go from competing with AMOSS (Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce) to joining one of them, and the company that really made the most sense for them to team up with,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Laurie McCabe, an analyst and founder at SMB Group, agrees with Leary&amp;#8217;s take, saying Salesforce doesn&amp;#8217;t hesitate when it thinks the value is there. &amp;#8220;In this case, Slack gives them a strong collaboration offering that will help them compete more effectively against Microsoft\u2019s growing cloud portfolio, which of course includes CRM and Teams,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Show me the money&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Battery&amp;#8217;s Agrawal believes this deal is all about generating revenue, and it was willing to pay a premium to move the needle in billion-dollar chunks. The end game he believes is about catching Microsoft, or at the very least getting to $1 trillion (with a T, folks) in market cap.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that investors are not showing signs, initially at least, of liking this deal, with the stock down over 8% today and 16.5% since the rumor of Salesforce&amp;#8217;s interest in Slack surfaced last week before the Thanksgiving holiday. That translates into more than $18 billion in lost market cap &amp;#8212; probably not the reaction they were hoping for. But Salesforce is big enough that it can afford to play a long game, and reach its financial goals with the help of Slack.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9gpWOekdIV\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/25\/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition\/\"&gt;Slack\u2019s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Slack\u2019s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/25\/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=9gpWOekdIV\" data-secret=\"9gpWOekdIV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;To get to a market cap of $1 trillion, Salesforce now has to take MSFT head on. Until now, the company has mostly been able to stay in its own swim lane in terms of products. [&amp;#8230;] To get to a trillion dollars in market cap, Salesforce needs to try to grow in two massive markets,&amp;#8221; Agrawal said. Those would be either knowledge worker\/desktop (see &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/08\/01\/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m\/\"&gt;the 2016 Quip acquisition&lt;\/a&gt;) or cloud (see &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud\/\"&gt;the Hyperforce announcement&lt;\/a&gt;). Agrawal says chances are the company&amp;#8217;s best bet is the former, and it was willing to pay top dollar to get it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The deal will help Salesforce maintain a 20%+ growth rate over the next few years,&amp;#8221; he said. Ultimately, he sees it moving the revenue needle, which should eventually drive market cap higher and help achieve those goals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce president and CEO &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/bret-taylor\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"bret-taylor\"&gt;Bret Taylor &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; said while they intend to integrate Slack deeply into the Salesforce product family, they recognize the power and utility of Slack as a standalone product and they don&amp;#8217;t intend to do anything that would mess with that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Fundamentally, we want to make sure that Slack remains as a kind of technology-agnostic platform. We know that Slack is used by millions and millions of people every day to connect every tool under the sun. The most remarkable thing is just how many customers have also just integrated their own custom internal tools as well into this is really kind of the central nervous system for the teams that use it, and we would never want to change that,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to judge a deal this large until we have some hindsight and see how well the two companies have meshed, how well they can incorporate Slack into the Salesforce ecosystem, while allowing that independence Taylor alluded to. If they can find a way to walk that line and Slack becomes that wrapper, that operating system, that glue that holds the Salesforce ecosystem together, it will be a good deal, but if Slack stops innovating and withers under the weight of its corporate overlords, then it might not be money well spent.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time will tell which is the case.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iK7LtPqecI\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-buys-slack\/\"&gt;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-buys-slack\/embed\/#?secret=iK7LtPqecI\" data-secret=\"iK7LtPqecI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;When the Salesforce-Slack deal was officially announced on Tuesday afternoon, and the number appeared, it was kind of hard to believe.

home:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Startups are subject to something like infant mortality: before they\u2019re established, one thing going wrong can kill the company. Hardware companies seem to be subject to infant mortality their whole lives.&lt;br \/&gt;\nI think the reason is that the evolution of the product is so discontinuous. The company has to keep shipping, and customers to keep buying, new products. Which in practice is like relaunching the company each time.&lt;br \/&gt;\nI don\u2019t know if there is an answer to this, but if there were a way for hardware companies to evolve more the way software companies do, they\u2019d be a lot more resilient.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back on our startup journey at &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/minut\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"minut\"&gt;Minut, &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; I remember several moments when we could have died. However, surviving several near misses we learned to tackle these challenges and have become more resilient over time. While there will never be one fully exhaustive answer, here are some of the lessons we learned over the years:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Subscription revenue is the only revenue that counts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While you can sell hardware with a margin and make important early revenue, it\u2019s not a sustainable business model for a company that requires both software and hardware. You can\u2019t cover an indefinite commitment with a finite amount of money.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many hardware companies don\u2019t consider subscriptions early enough. While it can be hard to command a subscription from the start (if you can, you might have waited too long to launch), it needs to be in the plan from the beginning. Look for markets where paying subscriptions is the norm rather than markets that operate on a one-time sale model.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Set high margins and earn them over time&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s tempting to set low prices for hardware to attract customers, but in the beginning you should do the opposite. Margins allow for mistakes to be rectified. A missed deadline might mean you have to opt for freight by air rather than boat. You might have to scrap components or buy them expensively in a supply crunch. Surprises are seldom positive, and you don\u2019t want to use your venture capital to pay for them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthy margins can also be used to cover marketing costs while you learn what kind of messaging works and what channels you can sell through. If that wasn\u2019t enough reason, starting with relatively high prices will help you avoid another common mistake, selling too much at launch.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This might seem counterintuitive \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t you want great success out of the gate? The reason is that you will inevitably make mistakes with your early launches, and the bigger the launch, the bigger the blow. There are plenty of companies who achieved amazing crowdfunding success and then failed to deliver even the first units. Startups tend to chase growth at all costs, but for hardware startups in the first few years there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.&lt;div

The co-viewing feature was first &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\"&gt;introduced&lt;\/a&gt; during the earlier days of the pandemic in 2020, allowing Hulu users to watch shows together from different locations, as well as chat and react to what they&amp;#8217;re watching in a group chat interface on the side of the screen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, the feature was &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\"&gt;only made available to Hulu&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;No Ads&amp;#8221; subscribers&lt;\/a&gt; before being tested with Hulu&amp;#8217;s ad-supported subscribers in a more limited capacity. To celebrate the Season 2 premiere of Hulu Original &amp;#8220;Pen15,&amp;#8221; the company had offered the Watch Party experience to its ad-supported customers for 10 days, starting on September 18.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In November, Hulu began testing the Watch Party feature &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/03\/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams\/\"&gt;with election news live streams&lt;\/a&gt; &amp;#8212; the first time it had offered co-viewing with its live content.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WfQz17EYb6\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/03\/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams\/\"&gt;Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/03\/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams\/embed\/#?secret=WfQz17EYb6\" data-secret=\"WfQz17EYb6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, Hulu says Watch Party is no longer in a &amp;#8220;test&amp;#8221; phase, and is now officially available to both sets of on-demand customers, including those on its commercial-free and ad-supported plans alike.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At launch, Watch Party works across thousands of on-demand titles from Hulu&amp;#8217;s library. This includes not only Hulu&amp;#8217;s own original content but also other licensed and broadcast programs like &amp;#8220;The Golden Girls,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;This Is Us,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Family Guy&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;The Bachelorette&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; all of which Hulu said had been popular titles for Watch Party during the testing period.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To use Watch Party, you&amp;#8217;ll look for the new Watch Party icon that appears on a title&amp;#8217;s detail page on Hulu.com. This will provide a link that you can then share with up to seven other Hulu subscribers, age 18 or older. The experience doesn&amp;#8217;t require a browser plugin, but works directly on the Hulu website itself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the program plays, users can chat and react with emoji in the group chat window, or even pause the viewing experience if they need to take a quick break.

NG-001 is meant to complement medication and other treatments, and once it is prescribed by a clinician, patients can access its cognitive exercises and tasks through a tablet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Neuroglee founder and CEO Aniket Singh Rajput (brother of Kuldeep) told TechCrunch that its first target markets for NG-001 are the United States and Singapore, followed by Japan. NG-001 needs to gain regulatory approval in each country, and it will start by seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once it launches, clinicians will have two ways to prescribe NG-001, through their healthcare provider platform or an electronic prescription tool. A platform called Neuroglee Connect will give clinicians, caregivers and patients access to support and features for reimbursement and coverage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The software tracks patients\u2019 progress, such as the speed of their fingers and the time it takes to complete an exercise, and delivers personalized treatment programs. It also has features to address the mental health of patients, including one that shows images that can bring up positive memories, which in turn can help alleviate depression and anxiety when used in tandem with other cognitive behavioral therapy techniques.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For caregivers and clinicians, NG-001 helps them track patient progress and their compliance with other treatments, like medications. This means that healthcare providers can work closely with patients even remotely, which is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"q52wGcJb9I\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/11\/as-alzheimers-costs-soar-startups-like-neurotrack-raise-cash-to-diagnose-and-treat-the-disease\/\"&gt;As Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s costs soar, startups like Neurotrack raise cash to diagnose and treat the disease&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;As Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s costs soar, startups like Neurotrack raise cash to diagnose and treat the disease&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/11\/as-alzheimers-costs-soar-startups-like-neurotrack-raise-cash-to-diagnose-and-treat-the-disease\/embed\/#?secret=q52wGcJb9I\" data-secret=\"q52wGcJb9I\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;There are now about 50 million people with dementia globally, a number the World Health Organization expects to triple by 2050.

(Though it did also tackle English too.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Two years on the startup&amp;#8217;s marketing focus is broader; today it talks about its customer service automation platform as an &amp;#8220;AI-first&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;no code&amp;#8217; tool &amp;#8212; sating it wants to empower b2c users to get the most out of AI by helping them design virtual agents that can usefully handle complex customer interactions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/ultimate-ai\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"ultimate-ai\"&gt;ultimate.ai &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; will hand-hold you through the process of building a super savvy customer service robot, is the pitch.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Co-founder and CEO Reetu Kainulainen claims it&amp;#8217;s always been &amp;#8220;no code and intuitive&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; though there&amp;#8217;s now a handy reference label to align what it&amp;#8217;s doing with a wider b2b trend.

Our vision has always been the big picture: Of automation becoming one of the primary means of providing customer service.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Having multilingual smarts remains an advantage, with ultimate.ai&amp;#8217;s virtual agents able to handle interactions in over 20 languages at this point.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&amp;#8220;Our market &amp;#8212; the customer service automation market &amp;#8212; has a lot of players,&amp;#8221; Kainulainen goes on, name-checking the likes of &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/18\/ada-nets-19-million-series-a-to-grow-its-customer-service-chatbot\/\"&gt;Ada Support&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/28\/salesforce-makes-some-einstein-ai-algorithms-available-to-third-party-developers\/\"&gt;Einstein Bots&lt;\/a&gt; (Salesforce\u2019s own solution) as key competitors.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&amp;#8220;This is because it is new and, until recently, solutions were so early that there were virtually no barriers to entry. But the market has changed a lot in the last four years. There are now only a handful of players globally that are worth paying attention to and we are one of them.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2016-founded startup is hitting the nail on the head for a growing number of customers &amp;#8212; with close to 100 signed up to its platform at this point, including the likes of Deezer, Telia, Footasylum, and Finnair. Per Kainulainen, it works best for &amp;#8220;b2c brands with large (and often repetitive) customer service volumes&amp;#8221;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is where automation can provide a huge impact from day one and really free up people to take on more creative and challenging work. We have a broad customer base of close to 100 great brands&amp;#8230; and do particularly well in industries like retail\/ecommerce, telecommunications and travel,&amp;#8221; he adds.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s enjoyed a major growth spurt this year, as businesses of all stripes were forced to ramp up their attention to online customer interactions as the coronavirus pandemic became an engine for digital activity.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Customer retention has also risen in priority for many businesses, as a highly contagious virus and public health safety measures put in place to reduce its spread, flipped markets into recession &amp;#8212; which Kainulainen points to as another growth driver.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, he says it&amp;#8217;s tripled ARR over the last 12 months (albeit, it was the same growth story last year too). Plus it&amp;#8217;s tripled headcount to deal with the COVID-19 effect.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now ultimate.ai is gearing up for fresh growth &amp;#8212; saying it&amp;#8217;s expecting major developments next year.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;COVID-19 has&amp;#8230; prompted one of the most accelerated periods of change in the customer service industry,&amp;#8221; says Kainulainen, predicting 2021 will bring &amp;#8220;immense innovation&amp;#8221; in the space &amp;#8212; and that &amp;#8220;booming&amp;#8221; automation technologies will take &amp;#8220;center stage&amp;#8221;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;#8217;s a convenient narrative for a customer service chatbot maker to tell.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But COVID-19 is clearly accelerating digital transformation of consumer focused businesses &amp;#8212; a movement that, logically, pumps demand for smarter tools to handle online customer support. So those positioned to harness new momentum for customer service automation &amp;#8212; by being able to offer an accessible, scalable and effective product (as ultimate.ai claims it does) &amp;#8212; are sitting pretty in the middle of a pandemic.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&amp;#8220;We believe that the best product will win this market,&amp;#8221; adds Kainulainen. &amp;#8220;We have a big vision for what we want &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/ultimate.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/ultimate.ai\/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1606934261525000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHQAmj-YBWsjt_0IRW7U5fUHRE1dA\"&gt;ultimate.ai&lt;\/a&gt; to be. Market maturity for our technology has accelerated massively in 2020, achieving in one year what could have probably taken five. We will capitalize on that by building more, faster.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The Series A funding will go on sales and marketing, with a planned market push in North America and a desire to go deeper throughout Europe, as well as being ploughed into further product development.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;And while &amp;#8212; clearly &amp;#8212; not every potential b2c customer will be able to &amp;#8216;automagic&amp;#8217; away 80% of their customer support pings, Kainulainen argues ultimate.ai can still offer a compelling sales pitch to businesses with more &amp;#8220;consultative&amp;#8221; customer support needs, where automation will only be able to play a far more limited role.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s often a strong correlation between how consultative a customer service organization needs to be and how highly trained and experienced their team is. In other words, it is often the case that organizations with \u2018lower bound\u2019 automation potential also only need 10% automation to still drive a huge ROI,&amp;#8221; he suggests.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&amp;#8220;For example, one of our customers is a large national pharmacy group, where customer service agents are qualified pharmacists who provide prescription medical advice. Here, the goal isn\u2019t to achieve a very high automation rate but rather to automate basic, repetitive processes to free up the pharmacists for more challenging tasks that better use their capabilities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&amp;#8220;For this customer, in addition to the automation of simple requests (which alone provides a huge value) our real-time answer recommendations help pharmacists respond faster and easier.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Omers Ventures managing partner, Jambu Palaniappan, dubbed the startup&amp;#8217;s growth &amp;#8220;truly spectacular&amp;#8221;, as well as lauding its &amp;#8220;world-class team&amp;#8221; and founders &amp;#8220;with a strong vision and unrivalled knowledge of AI&amp;#8221;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There are numerous chatbot companies out there but ultimate.ai represents something much bigger because at its core is an automation company with massive potential,&amp;#8221; he added. &amp;#8220;We look forward to working with Sarah, Reetu, Jaakko, and Markus as they expand internationally and advance their deep product capabilities even further.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe customer service industry is undergoing an automation revolution. In ultimate.ai, we saw a vision that\u2019s bold enough to lead the way,&amp;#8221; added Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, in another supporting statement. &amp;#8220;We believe that, just in the same way that category leaders have defined marketing and sales automation, ultimate.ai will do the same for customer service.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jambu Palaniappan, managing partner at Omers Ventures, will join the ultimate.ai board. Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, will join as an investor, alongside former head of Airbnb for Business Mark McCabe, and former EVP global sales of payment giant Adyen, Thijn Lamers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"mJdmD8VUlW\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/10\/salesforce-and-google-want-to-build-a-smarter-customer-service-experience\/\"&gt;Salesforce and Google want to build a smarter customer service experience&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Salesforce and Google want to build a smarter customer service experience&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/10\/salesforce-and-google-want-to-build-a-smarter-customer-service-experience\/embed\/#?secret=mJdmD8VUlW\" data-secret=\"mJdmD8VUlW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MZ6jfOU4W6\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/18\/ada-nets-19-million-series-a-to-grow-its-customer-service-chatbot\/\"&gt;Ada nets $19 million Series A to grow its customer service chatbot&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Ada nets $19 million Series A to grow its customer service chatbot&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/18\/ada-nets-19-million-series-a-to-grow-its-customer-service-chatbot\/embed\/#?secret=MZ6jfOU4W6\" data-secret=\"MZ6jfOU4W6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Ultimate.ai, a virtual customer service agent builder, has closed a $20 million Series A round of funding, led by Omers Ventures with participation from Felicis Ventures and existing investors HV Capital, and Maki.vc &amp;#8212; bringing its total raised to date to $25M+.

But the company also operates an &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/bolt.eu\/en\/scooters\/\"&gt;electric scooter service&lt;\/a&gt; in 45 cities across Europe. Designed by the company\u2019s in-house hardware team, the new model focuses on safety.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the photo, it\u2019s a big scooter that weighs 19kg \u2014 that\u2019s more than an average bike. It has a battery with a 40km range and it is primarily made of aluminum.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company says it should last up to 60 months thanks to a modular design. &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/mtakso\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mtakso\"&gt;Bolt &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; can replace parts without having to replace the scooter altogether.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, you\u2019ll find built-in sensors to detect accidents and unsafe riding. If you fall or if you brake sharply, Bolt can be alerted. The scooter also recognizes unsafe riding patterns. Combined with audio and visual warnings, it should educate riders about what you\u2019re supposed to do and not do.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the integrated dashboard, you can receive alerts telling you that you\u2019re riding in a pedestrian area, or in a low-speed area. You can also see if you\u2019re allowed to park in this area. Bolt plans to turn on front light blinking when you enter a pedestrian or low-speed area.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like most modern e-scooter models, Bolt can swap the battery without having to move the entire scooter. It is much more efficient to recharge detachable batteries than scooters themselves.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Bolt unveiled plans to double-down on scooters. It plans to operate a scooter service in more than 100 cities in 2021. There could be as many as 130,000 electric scooters and electric bikes in European cities. Let\u2019s see if the company delivers on its ambitious 2021 roadmap.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\"attachment_2081907\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2081907\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"676\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2081907\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg 1965w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg?resize=768,507 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg?resize=680,449 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg?resize=1536,1015 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Bolt_4_scooter_2b.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/&gt;&lt;p id=\"caption-attachment-2081907\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"&gt;Image Credits: Bolt&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WEm1WycHbJ\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars\/\"&gt;How four European cities are embracing micromobility to drive out cars&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;How four European cities are embracing micromobility to drive out cars&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars\/embed\/#?secret=WEm1WycHbJ\" data-secret=\"WEm1WycHbJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Bolt is better known for its ride-hailing service.

The startup had been engaging with investors for new capital for several quarters and, in at least one instance, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/03\/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch\/\"&gt;struggled to raise funds at a $3 billion valuation earlier this year&lt;\/a&gt;, TechCrunch reported earlier. It had hoped to raise about $1 billion at a valuation as high as $10 billion last year, however, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The partial spin-off, which had been in the works for more than a year, means that Flipkart&amp;#8217;s stake in PhonePe will reduce from 100% to 87%. &amp;#8220;This partial spin-off gives PhonePe access to dedicated long-term capital to pursue our vision of providing financial inclusion to a billion Indians,&amp;#8221; said Sameer Nigam, founder and chief executive of PhonePe, in a statement.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Flipkart will remain PhonePe\u2019s majority shareholder, and the &amp;#8220;two businesses will retain their close collaboration,&amp;#8221; PhonePe said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PhonePe, which means &amp;#8220;on the phone&amp;#8221; in Hindi, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/02\/walmarts-phonepe-zips-past-google-pay-in-india-as-upi-tops-2-billion-monthly-transactions\/\"&gt;currently leads the mobile payments market in India&lt;\/a&gt;, by some metrics. In October, it surpassed Google Pay to become the top UPI payments app. UPI is a four-year-old payments infrastructure built by India\u2019s largest banks. It is the most popular way people transact money digitally in India.\u00a0PhonePe reported 835 million UPI transactions in October, ahead of Google Pay, which processed about 820 million transactions that month.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAs Flipkart Commerce continues to grow strongly serving the needs of Indian customers, we are excited at the future prospects of the group. This move will help PhonePe maximize its potential as it moves to the next phase of its development, and it will also maximize value creation for Flipkart and our shareholders,\u201d said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO of Flipkart Group, in a statement.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a recent report to clients, analysts at Bernstein identified PhonePe as one of the startups in India that could file for an IPO in within three years. PhonePe&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;reliance on parent Flipkart has shrunk, from 50% of monthly transactions to less than 1% today. PhonePe was first to launch on UPI and has extended into new use cases including travel booking, bill payments, financial services etc. The company has also launched Switch which allows users to switch between PhonePe and other apps like food, grocery delivery etc. (Super App),&amp;#8221; they wrote.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PhonePe, which has amassed over 100 million monthly active users, could look to expand outside of India, the analysts wrote in the report, which was obtained by TechCrunch.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PhonePe and Google Pay today also compete with &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\"&gt;Paytm, &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; which is backed by SoftBank and Alibaba. Paytm, which was &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/24\/paytm-1-billion\/\"&gt;privately valued at $16 billion last year when it raised $1 billion&lt;\/a&gt;, has shifted its attention to cater to merchants in recent quarters as UPI currently offers no way for companies to make any money on its platform.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At an event in Bangalore late last year, Sajith Sivanandan, managing director and business head of Google Pay and Next Billion User Initiatives, said current local rules in India have forced Google Pay to operate without a clear business model in the country.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If that wasn&amp;#8217;t a challenge enough, WhatsApp, which is the most popular smartphone app in India with over 400 million users in the world&amp;#8217;s second largest market, began &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india\/\"&gt;rolling out its payments service in the country last month&lt;\/a&gt;.

It\u2019s also revealing a $8.4 million (\u00a36.3million) investment, led by &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/firstminute-capital\"&gt;firstminute capital&lt;\/a&gt;, which includes funding from Hoxton Ventures, Taylor Brothers, Ocado Group and the UK\u2019s government-backed Future Fund. It has now closed a total of \u00a313.5m in funding.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/karakuri\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"karakuri\"&gt;Karakuri\u2019s &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; robotic system has been initially designed to make breakfast bowls. But the technology will end up being employed in a large array of scenarios, including restaurants, canteens, buffets, hotels and supermarkets. Posibly even tending vertical farms. It\u2019s particular strength is in being able to create extremely tailor-made combinations of food, putting &amp;#8216;personalized nutrition\u2019 within practical reach. Remember those movies where the food is tailored by a robot? That.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post-Covid world is also highly likely to embrace this technology due to the robot&amp;#8217;s inherent cleanliness and efficiency, compared to human-made food. That said, Karakuri is not positioned to replace humans but to augment them, taking on the boring and repetitive tasks which typically see kitchen staff have far more itinerant careers due to the sheer pressure of low-level jobs where a robot would be far more suitable.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The DK-One robot is Karakuri\u2019s first pre-production machine which uses the latest in robotics, sensing and control technologies. It\u2019s capable of creating high quality hot and cold meals, which maximize nutritional benefits, restaurant performance and minimize food waste.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"&gt;&lt;iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9Vesx0iFc5U?version=3&amp;#038;rel=1&amp;#038;showsearch=0&amp;#038;showinfo=1&amp;#038;iv_load_policy=1&amp;#038;fs=1&amp;#038;hl=en-US&amp;#038;autohide=2&amp;#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Post-COVID restrictions, further on-customer-site trials of the DK-One are expected to take place in the first half of 2021.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The DK-One robot zips around a circular enclosure at a rate of knots, each time measuring accurate portion sizes as determined by an app, where the customer can tailor to their tastes. It means anyone ordering something would be able to track the ingredients, nutrients, calories, and quantity of literally every meal.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Up to 18 ingredients can be dispensed per installation, with each ingredient temperature controlled. It will dispense of any ingredient type including wet, dry, soft, or hard food onto plates, bowls, or a range of meal containers&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because it\u2019s so accurate it, therefore, reduces food waste around portions and allows for real-time data on ingredients. The thin margins restaurateurs typically have could be improved by using such a robot in repetitive tasks, and means employees can be tasked with more complex and fruitful and fulfilling work. It\u2019s also easily integrated into existing commercial kitchens.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Barney Wragg, CEO and co-founder of Karakuri, said in a statement: \u201cThis will be the first time we can use a pre-production machine to demonstrate the DK-One\u2019s commercial and nutritional benefits in the real world and thus demonstrate our vision for the future of food.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Karakuri was founded by Simon Watt and Wragg, two longtime friends and colleagues who previously worked together at ARM.

AutoX, a four-year-old startup backed by Alibaba, MediaTek and Shanghai Motors, is deploying a fleet of 25 unmanned vehicles in downtown Shenzhen, marking the first time any autonomous driving car in China tests without safety drivers or remote operators on public roads.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The cars, meant as robotaxis, are not yet open to the public, an &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/autox-ac12\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"autox-ac12\"&gt;AutoX &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; spokesperson told TechCrunch.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The milestone came just five months after AutoX &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/autonomous-vehicle-startup-autox-lands-driverless-testing-permit-in-california\/\"&gt;landed a permit from California&lt;\/a&gt; to start driverless tests, following in the footsteps of Waymo and Nuro.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It also indicates that China wants to bring its smart driving industry on par with the U.S. Cities from Shenzhen to Shanghai are competing to attract autonomous driving upstarts by clearing regulatory hurdles, touting subsidies and putting up 5G infrastructure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, each city ends up with its own poster child in the space: AutoX and Deeproute.ai in Shenzhen, Pony.ai and WeRide in Guangzhou, &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/momenta-ai\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"momenta-ai\"&gt;Momenta &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; in Suzhou, Baidu&amp;#8217;s Apollo fleet in Beijing, to name a few. The autonomous driving companies, in turn, work closely with traditional carmakers to make their vehicles smarter and more suitable for future transportation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We have obtained support from the local government. Shenzhen is making a lot of rapid progress on legislation for self-driving cars,&amp;#8221; said the AutoX representative.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The decision to remove drivers from the front &lt;em&gt;and&lt;\/em&gt; operators from a remote center appears a bold move in one of China&amp;#8217;s most populated cities. AutoX equips its vehicles with its proprietary vehicle control unit called XCU, which it &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/07\/autox-and-fiat-chrysler-are-teaming-up-on-a-robotaxi-for-china\/\"&gt;claims&lt;\/a&gt; has faster processing speed and more computational capability to handle the complex road scenarios in China\u2019s cities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[The XCU] provides multiple layers of redundancy to handle this kind of situation,&amp;#8221; said AutoX when asked how its vehicles will respond should the machines ever go rogue.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company also stressed the experience it learned from &amp;#8220;millions of miles&amp;#8221; driven in China&amp;#8217;s densest city centers through its 100 robotaxis in the past few years. Its rivals are also aggressively accumulating mileage to train their self-driving algorithms while banking sizable investments to fund R&amp;amp;D and pilot tests. AutoX itself, for instance, has raised &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/autox-ac12\"&gt;more than $160 million&lt;\/a&gt; to date.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DSspKZwJmN\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/13\/momenta-profile\/\"&gt;How China&amp;#8217;s first autonomous driving unicorn Momenta hunts for data&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;How China&amp;#8217;s first autonomous driving unicorn Momenta hunts for data&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/13\/momenta-profile\/embed\/#?secret=DSspKZwJmN\" data-secret=\"DSspKZwJmN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Residents of Shenzhen will see truly driverless cars on the road starting Thursday.

They had\u00a0organized around a variety of topics, including Google\u2019s treatment of its temporary, vendor and contractor workers, Google\u2019s alleged retaliation against employees who organized, the company\u2019s work with Customs and Border Protection and more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in November 2019, Google put Rebecca Rivers and Berland on leave for allegedly violating company policies. At the time, Google said one had searched for and shared confidential documents that were not pertinent to their job, and one had looked at the individual calendars of some staffers. Following a protest in support of the two, Rivers, Berland, Duke and Waldman were fired.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&amp;#8220;Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees,&amp;#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &amp;#8220;Of course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously. We\u2019re confident in our decision and legal position. Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.\u201d&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This comes shortly after the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/y3zav5\/google-contractors-say-their-work-is-being-shipped-to-poland-after-unionizing\"&gt;NLRB issued a formal complaint against Google contractor HCL&lt;\/a&gt;, alleging the company repeatedly violated the rights of unionized workers.

The company plans to start clinical trials next year. NG-001 is meant to complement medication and other treatments, and once it is prescribed by a clinician, patients can access its cognitive exercises and tasks through a tablet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Neuroglee founder and CEO Aniket Singh Rajput (brother of Kuldeep) told TechCrunch that its first target markets for NG-001 are the United States and Singapore, followed by Japan. NG-001 needs to gain regulatory approval in each country, and it will start by seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once it launches, clinicians will have two ways to prescribe NG-001, through their healthcare provider platform or an electronic prescription tool. A platform called Neuroglee Connect will give clinicians, caregivers and patients access to support and features for reimbursement and coverage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The software tracks patients\u2019 progress, such as the speed of their fingers and the time it takes to complete an exercise, and delivers personalized treatment programs. It also has features to address the mental health of patients, including one that shows images that can bring up positive memories, which in turn can help alleviate depression and anxiety when used in tandem with other cognitive behavioral therapy techniques.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For caregivers and clinicians, NG-001 helps them track patient progress and their compliance with other treatments, like medications.

The co-viewing feature was first &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\"&gt;introduced&lt;\/a&gt; during the earlier days of the pandemic in 2020, allowing Hulu users to watch shows together from different locations, as well as chat and react to what they&amp;#8217;re watching in a group chat interface on the side of the screen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, the feature was &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat\/\"&gt;only made available to Hulu&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;No Ads&amp;#8221; subscribers&lt;\/a&gt; before being tested with Hulu&amp;#8217;s ad-supported subscribers in a more limited capacity. To celebrate the Season 2 premiere of Hulu Original &amp;#8220;Pen15,&amp;#8221; the company had offered the Watch Party experience to its ad-supported customers for 10 days, starting on September 18.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In November, Hulu began testing the Watch Party feature &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/03\/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams\/\"&gt;with election news live streams&lt;\/a&gt; &amp;#8212; the first time it had offered co-viewing with its live content.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WfQz17EYb6\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/03\/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams\/\"&gt;Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/03\/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams\/embed\/#?secret=WfQz17EYb6\" data-secret=\"WfQz17EYb6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, Hulu says Watch Party is no longer in a &amp;#8220;test&amp;#8221; phase, and is now officially available to both sets of on-demand customers, including those on its commercial-free and ad-supported plans alike.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At launch, Watch Party works across thousands of on-demand titles from Hulu&amp;#8217;s library. This includes not only Hulu&amp;#8217;s own original content but also other licensed and broadcast programs like &amp;#8220;The Golden Girls,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;This Is Us,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Family Guy&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;The Bachelorette&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; all of which Hulu said had been popular titles for Watch Party during the testing period.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To use Watch Party, you&amp;#8217;ll look for the new Watch Party icon that appears on a title&amp;#8217;s detail page on Hulu.com. This will provide a link that you can then share with up to seven other Hulu subscribers, age 18 or older. The experience doesn&amp;#8217;t require a browser plugin, but works directly on the Hulu website itself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the program plays, users can chat and react with emoji in the group chat window, or even pause the viewing experience if they need to take a quick break. This won&amp;#8217;t pause the stream for other viewers, as with some other co-watching experiences &amp;#8212; instead, the user can rejoin the group and stay behind others or they can use a &amp;#8220;Click to Catch Up&amp;#8221; button in the chat window to get back in sync.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Co-watching has been a popular pandemic activity as people looked for ways to stay connected with friends and family when they couldn&amp;#8217;t spend time in person.

We&amp;#8217;re calculating the daily change between the preceding day&amp;#8217;s close and the listed day&amp;#8217;s final price:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;November 25: -5.4% (&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/25\/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition\/\"&gt;deal leaks midday&lt;\/a&gt;)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;November 27: +0.33%&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;November 30: -0.74%&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;December 1: -1.8% (deal is announced after-hours)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;December 2: -8.52%&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Salesforce saw its share price fall from around $264 before the deal became known to $220.78 at the end of regular trading today. The loss in value works out to 16.5%. From a different perspective, Salesforce lost around $18.7 billion in value today alone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those swings constitute a summary rejection of the deal by investors, I&amp;#8217;d say, or of &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition\/\"&gt;Salesforce&amp;#8217;s recently stated guidance&lt;\/a&gt;, which was inclusive of the deal. Salesforce has lost more value than the transaction is worth, which feels notable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"u0bFG4f7A1\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition\/\"&gt;Salesforce beats growth expectations as investors digest the Slack acquisition&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Salesforce beats growth expectations as investors digest the Slack acquisition&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=u0bFG4f7A1\" data-secret=\"u0bFG4f7A1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My gut says that investors are worried that Salesforce is overpaying for Slack, and that potential synergies between the two won&amp;#8217;t amount to as much as the two companies&amp;#8217; CEOs imagine. But I wanted to ask my colleague Ron Miller about the situation, to see if he could add anything to the &lt;em&gt;why isn&amp;#8217;t Wall Street liking this combo more&lt;\/em&gt; question. Here is his take:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Wall Street appears to be taking an initial dislike to the deal &amp;#8212; it is a big gaudy number &amp;#8212; over time I think they should come to understand it better. Slack will give Salesforce the social piece it has been longing for since the days of Enterprise 2.0. They initially tried to build it themselves with Chatter, but that never quite caught on. Ten years later, they finally have their social component.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benioff&amp;#8217;s instincts about what his company needs are usually on target, and while he may have overpaid for this bauble, the ability to tie his company&amp;#8217;s products together under Slack&amp;#8217;s communications and work integration umbrella proved too attractive to resist.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t forget in spite of the fact that Microsoft Teams is making headway, mostly by giving it away for free with Office 365 subscriptions, Slack remains the darling of the developer class. And as long as Salesforce finds a way for it to maintain its independence, the marriage could work out. At the very least, it deserves a chance to prove that it can.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Shares of Salesforce traded lower today, despite the company hosting a multi-hour keynote that included a buffet of Marc Benioff.

The company sees a key missing piece in &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/slack\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"slack\"&gt;Slack, &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; and that could explain why it was willing to spend such an astonishing amount of money to get it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Slack, Salesforce now has what CEO Marc Benioff called the interface to everything, something he says that the company has thought about for years. In 2010, they tried building it themselves with Chatter, a social tool that never really caught on in a big way. With Slack they finally have it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve always had the vision of the social enterprise at Salesforce for more than a decade. Oh, we&amp;#8217;ve had Dreamforces entirely dedicated to the vision of what a collaborative interface, a high production interface with applications and an ecosystem would look like wrapped on top of our Customer 360,&amp;#8221; Benioff said.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He added that ironically in a building right next door to Salesforce Park you&amp;#8217;ll find Slack headquarters. They won&amp;#8217;t have to go far to collaborate (or you know, they can just use Slack).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;From Chatter to Slack&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures, says that Benioff has had an interest in enterprise social going back years, and this is his way of finally delivering. &amp;#8220;Remember Chatter? Benioff was dead on with this trend. He &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/06\/25\/its-official-microsoft-confirms-it-has-acquired-yammer-for-1-2-billion-in-cash\/\"&gt;lost Yammer to Microsoft&lt;\/a&gt; (when Microsoft acquired it for $1.2 billion) about 7-8 years ago, and then launched Chatter. It was a huge bet, but didn\u2019t work. Slack is really Chatter 2.0,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck Ganapathi, CEO and co-founder at Tact.ai, was product lead on the Chatter product at Salesforce in the 2009 time frame. He wrote in a soon-to-be-published blog post he shared with TechCrunch that it failed for a lot of reasons, but mostly because at its core, Salesforce was still a bunch of database guys and enterprise social was a very different animal.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"G3E7rVS2Z3\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/30\/as-slack-acquisition-rumors-swirl-a-look-at-salesforces-six-biggest-deals\/\"&gt;As Slack acquisition rumors swirl, a look at Salesforce&amp;#8217;s six biggest deals&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;As Slack acquisition rumors swirl, a look at Salesforce&amp;#8217;s six biggest deals&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/30\/as-slack-acquisition-rumors-swirl-a-look-at-salesforces-six-biggest-deals\/embed\/#?secret=G3E7rVS2Z3\" data-secret=\"G3E7rVS2Z3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Some of the issues were technical &amp;#8212; Salesforce is a database-centric company, founded by Oracle alums on a relational DB foundation. DB applications and unstructured communication applications like Chatter or Slack represent completely different branches of computer science with little overlap,&amp;#8221; he wrote. Because of that, he felt that they lacked the expertise to build the application correctly, and it never really caught on, with so many similar products in the market at the time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But Benioff never lost interest in the concept of incorporating social into the Salesforce platform. It just took another 10 years or so and a bushel of money to make it happen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;A good match or not?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leyla Seka, a partner at Operator Capital, who formerly ran the AppExchange at Salesforce, sees good things ahead with a combined Slack and Salesforce. &amp;#8220;Salesforce and Slack together will offer a powerful duo of applications that will help companies work more effectively together. I think that COVID-19 has shown us how critical it is to get employees the data they need to do their job, but also the community they need to thrive at their job. The marriage of Salesforce and Slack promises to do just that,&amp;#8221; Seka told me.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Be8IVr1LHF\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud\/\"&gt;With Hyperforce, Salesforce lets you move your data to any public cloud&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;With Hyperforce, Salesforce lets you move your data to any public cloud&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud\/embed\/#?secret=Be8IVr1LHF\" data-secret=\"Be8IVr1LHF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, was knocked out by the price tag, but says it shows that Salesforce is not afraid to go after what it wants, even if it has to pay a hefty price to get it. &amp;#8220;This goes to show Salesforce has absolutely no fear in them when it comes to this deal. They are willing to throw down the big bucks on this acquisition because they see a huge payoff by adding this piece into their platform,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for Slack, he sees it as a way for them to take the fast track to the enterprise big leagues. &amp;#8220;And for Slack they go from competing with AMOSS (Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce) to joining one of them, and the company that really made the most sense for them to team up with,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Laurie McCabe, an analyst and founder at SMB Group, agrees with Leary&amp;#8217;s take, saying Salesforce doesn&amp;#8217;t hesitate when it thinks the value is there. &amp;#8220;In this case, Slack gives them a strong collaboration offering that will help them compete more effectively against Microsoft\u2019s growing cloud portfolio, which of course includes CRM and Teams,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Show me the money&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Battery&amp;#8217;s Agrawal believes this deal is all about generating revenue, and it was willing to pay a premium to move the needle in billion-dollar chunks. The end game he believes is about catching Microsoft, or at the very least getting to $1 trillion (with a T, folks) in market cap.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that investors are not showing signs, initially at least, of liking this deal, with the stock down over 8% today and 16.5% since the rumor of Salesforce&amp;#8217;s interest in Slack surfaced last week before the Thanksgiving holiday. That translates into more than $18 billion in lost market cap &amp;#8212; probably not the reaction they were hoping for. But Salesforce is big enough that it can afford to play a long game, and reach its financial goals with the help of Slack.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9gpWOekdIV\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/25\/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition\/\"&gt;Slack\u2019s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Slack\u2019s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/25\/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=9gpWOekdIV\" data-secret=\"9gpWOekdIV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;To get to a market cap of $1 trillion, Salesforce now has to take MSFT head on. Until now, the company has mostly been able to stay in its own swim lane in terms of products. [&amp;#8230;] To get to a trillion dollars in market cap, Salesforce needs to try to grow in two massive markets,&amp;#8221; Agrawal said. Those would be either knowledge worker\/desktop (see &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/08\/01\/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m\/\"&gt;the 2016 Quip acquisition&lt;\/a&gt;) or cloud (see &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud\/\"&gt;the Hyperforce announcement&lt;\/a&gt;). Agrawal says chances are the company&amp;#8217;s best bet is the former, and it was willing to pay top dollar to get it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The deal will help Salesforce maintain a 20%+ growth rate over the next few years,&amp;#8221; he said. Ultimately, he sees it moving the revenue needle, which should eventually drive market cap higher and help achieve those goals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce president and CEO &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/bret-taylor\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"bret-taylor\"&gt;Bret Taylor &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; said while they intend to integrate Slack deeply into the Salesforce product family, they recognize the power and utility of Slack as a standalone product and they don&amp;#8217;t intend to do anything that would mess with that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Fundamentally, we want to make sure that Slack remains as a kind of technology-agnostic platform. We know that Slack is used by millions and millions of people every day to connect every tool under the sun. The most remarkable thing is just how many customers have also just integrated their own custom internal tools as well into this is really kind of the central nervous system for the teams that use it, and we would never want to change that,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to judge a deal this large until we have some hindsight and see how well the two companies have meshed, how well they can incorporate Slack into the Salesforce ecosystem, while allowing that independence Taylor alluded to. If they can find a way to walk that line and Slack becomes that wrapper, that operating system, that glue that holds the Salesforce ecosystem together, it will be a good deal, but if Slack stops innovating and withers under the weight of its corporate overlords, then it might not be money well spent.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time will tell which is the case.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iK7LtPqecI\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-buys-slack\/\"&gt;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/01\/salesforce-buys-slack\/embed\/#?secret=iK7LtPqecI\" data-secret=\"iK7LtPqecI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;When the Salesforce-Slack deal was officially announced on Tuesday afternoon, and the number appeared, it was kind of hard to believe.

What if it was more Pixar-like?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/sketchy.com\/\"&gt;Sketchy&lt;\/a&gt;, a visual learning platform, takes complex material that a med student might need to memorize for an exam, and puts the information in an illustrated scene. For example, it uses a countryside kingdom to explain the coronavirus, or a salmon dinner to explain Salmonella. The goal is for a student to be able to mentally go back to the scene while taking an exam, walk through it and retrieve all of the information.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Sketchy\u2019s strategy might seem odd, it\u2019s actually well-known. The &amp;#8220;memory palace&amp;#8221; technique matches objects to concepts for easier memorization. So far, Sketchy has more than 30,000 paid subscribers and is on track to hit $7 million in revenue this year.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To charge this growth and break into new content verticals, Sketchy is taking venture capital on for the first time in its seven-year history. Last month, the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200924005067\/en\/Leading-Online-Education-Startup-SketchyMedical-Secures-30-Million-Investment-From-TCG\"&gt;team announced&lt;\/a&gt; that it has raised a $30 million Series A led by &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/tcg.co\/\"&gt;The Chernin Group&lt;\/a&gt; (TCG). Today, some of those shares were sold in a secondary transaction &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reachcapital.com\/\"&gt;Reach Capital,&lt;\/a&gt; which now accounts for $3 million of the financing.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big combined investment for a company that has been bootstrapping since birth &amp;#8212; and the deal could help us see where online education is heading.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NIkRbOwkV4\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold\/\"&gt;Edtech investors are panning for gold&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Edtech investors are panning for gold&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold\/embed\/#?secret=NIkRbOwkV4\" data-secret=\"NIkRbOwkV4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The capital comes as Sketchy itself looks to grow past a content service for med students, and into an education platform tackling information in critical fields, from legal to nursing. With the new money, Sketchy plans to build an in-house animation studio and hire more artists and doctors, some of whom are currently consultants.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The story&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A big part of Sketchy\u2019s magic, and effectiveness, comes from the fact that all of its founding team have experience in medicine.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company began in 2013 when then-med students Saud Siddiqui and Andrew Berg were in desperate need of a better study solution for microbiology. To liven up their studying, Berg and Siddiqui began weaving characters into stories to try to memorize concepts &amp;#8212; and after a few good test scores, they started creating stories for their classmates.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNeither Saud or I were artists, so they were pretty bad,\u201d Berg said. As demand continued, the duo put their scraggly sketches on YouTube. Eventually, Siddiqui and Berg roped in classmate Bryan Lemieux, a good artist, to tell the stories with them. Eventually Bryan brought on his twin brother, Aaron, and the founding team was born.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to today: Siddiqui and Berg have finished their residencies in emergency medicine, while the Lemieux brothers chose to leave medicine. All have moved full-time to the company after trying to balance both jobs. Still, the knowledge from working in the field continues to be useful.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The startup&amp;#8217;s name has evolved: born as SketchyMedical, it has since rebranded to just Sketchy. While the team chose the name to nod toward its focus on art, the name also has negative connotations. Expect a rebrand in the future.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the company claims that it is used by a third of med students in the United States. The majority of its revenues come from 12-month subscriptions for students looking to prep for med school exams like Step 1, and Step 2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While B2C is a promising business model for many reasons (it\u2019s always easier to convince a human to pay instead of a entire, red-tape-bound institution), the company has also posted promising B2B growth. So far, 20% of its revenue comes from direct contracts it has with medical schools. The founders said that they will pursue both growth methods for now, but based on the price of med school (and student debt crisis), it would be great to see them grow through school contracts so students don&amp;#8217;t have to face the brunt of costs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the coronavirus &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/reach-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"reach-capital\"&gt;Reach Capital\u2019s &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; Jennifer Carolan, an investor in Sketchy, said that Sketchy\u2019s product market fit with med students is a \u201cstrong signal that their content is worth it.\u201d Even with competitors such as Picorize and Medcomic, she\u2019s confident that Sketchy\u2019s product is defensible and can expand into new verticals. Part of the reason the firm approached Sketchy to invest in them is because of low customer acquisition costs, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/reachcapital.medium.com\/sketchy-5b57affb5ad4\"&gt;Carolan notes in a blog post.\u00a0&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, unlike most edtech companies, which have enjoyed surging new user demand thanks to remote learning, Sketchy didn\u2019t have a huge COVID-19 boom.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe weren&amp;#8217;t one of those people that hadn&amp;#8217;t found product market fit and then exploded after COVID,\u201d said Berg. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been there and been growing.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So the real trigger for today\u2019s fundraise wasn\u2019t COVID-19 momentum, but instead, a push to capitalize its sustained growth into more digital curriculum verticals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Long-term, think of Sketchy as joining a chorus of startups, including Top Hat Jr and Newsela, that want to replace textbook publishers. In a remote world, live, moving content is more rapidly losing value, and upstarts are trying to replace them with more effective and engaging content.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOne of the challenges is just to make sure we don&amp;#8217;t go too fast,\u201d Siddiqui said. \u201cWe want to keep that degree of quality we\u2019ve maintained for so many years, and do it at scale.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s note: The original version of this story stated that Sketchy had raised $32 million. This is incorrect. The company raised $30 million along with a secondary transaction from Reach Capital.\u00a0&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cj6RkYOzGa\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/26\/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call\/\"&gt;Equity Dive: Edtech\u2019s 2020 wakeup call&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Equity Dive: Edtech\u2019s 2020 wakeup call&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/26\/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call\/embed\/#?secret=cj6RkYOzGa\" data-secret=\"cj6RkYOzGa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Studying for med school is tough.

Today, the company says &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/amazonfiretv.blog\/two-way-video-calling-with-fire-tv-cube-649648f92562\"&gt;two-way video calling is now available&lt;\/a&gt; with its Fire TV Cube devices (2nd gen.). The new feature will allow customers to pair a third-party webcam with their Fire TV Cube in order to make and receive video calls from their TVs to any other Alexa device with a screen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That means customers could call other Alexa owners who have a Fire TV Cube of their own, an Echo device with a screen like the Echo Show or even just the Alexa app installed on a smartphone or tablet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the feature to work, Amazon says the third-party video cams will need to meet certain minimum requirements, including UVC support, 720p resolution and 30 frames per sec (fps). Amazon, however, recommends that a better experience will be had with cameras with 1080p resolution and 60-90 degree field of view (FOV). It advises against 4K webcams.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company also says a better experience will be had with a field of view from six to 10 feet away from the TV, but not greater than 12 feet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The webcams themselves are connected to the Fire TV Cube via a Micro USB to USB adapter.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dZEqNQWoEN\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/amazon-redesigns-fire-tv-introduces-new-fire-tv-stick-and-low-cost-fire-tv-stick-lite\/\"&gt;Amazon redesigns Fire TV, introduces new Fire TV Stick and low-cost Fire TV Stick Lite&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Amazon redesigns Fire TV, introduces new Fire TV Stick and low-cost Fire TV Stick Lite&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/amazon-redesigns-fire-tv-introduces-new-fire-tv-stick-and-low-cost-fire-tv-stick-lite\/embed\/#?secret=dZEqNQWoEN\" data-secret=\"dZEqNQWoEN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Amazon recommends the &lt;a class=\"cm jj\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-Widescreen-Calling-Recording-Desktop\/dp\/B006JH8T3S\/ref_=FTV_Blog_videocalling\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Logitech C920&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"cm jj\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-C922x-Pro-Stream-Webcam\/dp\/B01LXCDPPK?ref_=FTV_Blog_videocalling\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Logitech C922x&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"cm jj\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-960-000637-HD-Webcam-C310\/dp\/B003PAIV2Q\/ref_=FTV_Blog_videocalling\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Logitech C310&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"cm jj\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/AUKEY-Streaming-Microphone-Widescreen-Recording\/dp\/B072MMH33F\/ref_=FTV_Blog_videocalling\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Aukey PC-LM1E&lt;\/a&gt; or &lt;a class=\"cm jj\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Microphone-Wansview-Correction-Streaming-Conference\/dp\/B088D3VXC6\/ref_=FTV_Blog_videocalling\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Wansview 101JD\u00a0&lt;\/a&gt;webcams for those interested in trying the new feature.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once connected, users will need to open the Alexa app on their phone to enable the messaging and calling options, if they had not already, and import their contacts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To place a call, Alexa owners can say things like &amp;#8220;Alexa, call Julie&amp;#8217;s Echo,&amp;#8221; for example. They can then control the call experience with voice commands like &amp;#8220;Alexa, video on,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Alexa, volume up,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Alexa, answer&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Alexa, end call,&amp;#8221; among others.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Video chat support has been one of the key features for smart screens, like Amazon&amp;#8217;s Echo Show, but it makes sense to bring support for video calls to the living room&amp;#8217;s big screen, too, where possible.

Big tech&amp;#8217;s lobbying group made the opposite argument in response to the president&amp;#8217;s new threat.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Repealing Section 230 is itself a threat to national security,&amp;#8221; Internet Association Interim President and CEO Jon Berroya said in a statement. &amp;#8220;The law empowers online platforms to remove harmful and dangerous content, including terrorist content and misinformation.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Section 230, which protects internet companies from liability for the content they host, is currently at the center of a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/01\/section-230-hearing-big-tech\/\"&gt;complex bipartisan reform effort&lt;\/a&gt; \u2014 one that&amp;#8217;s nowhere near a consensus, much less an agreement that Section 230 should be scrapped outright.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ymyKTfWGVA\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/01\/section-230-hearing-big-tech\/\"&gt;Section 230 will be on the chopping block at the next big tech hearing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Section 230 will be on the chopping block at the next big tech hearing&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/01\/section-230-hearing-big-tech\/embed\/#?secret=ymyKTfWGVA\" data-secret=\"ymyKTfWGVA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;President Trump&amp;#8217;s threat to block the NDAA stakes out a deeply unpopular position. The sweeping defense budget bill includes all kinds of funding for popular programs that benefit U.S. troops and veterans, making a veto of the bill if the terms of a totally unrelated demand aren&amp;#8217;t met a strange gamble indeed. The fact that Trump&amp;#8217;s latest anti-230 tactic comes during a lame duck session gives his threat even less bite.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In light of that, most of Congress has gone about business as usual so far. But close Trump ally Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) did signal his support for Trump&amp;#8217;s position on Wednesday. &amp;#8220;The NDAA does NOT contain any reform to Section 230 but DOES contain Elizabeth Warren\u2019s social engineering amendment to unilaterally rename bases &amp;amp; war memorials w\/ no public input or process,&amp;#8221; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HawleyMO\/status\/1334205058494377986\"&gt;Hawley tweeted&lt;\/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;I cannot support it.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If history is any lesson, Trump isn&amp;#8217;t afraid to make an empty threat, eventually pivoting to something else that catches his attention. But Section 230 \u2014 previously a fairly arcane piece of legislation that attracted little mainstream attention \u2014 has &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/\"&gt;rankled Trump&lt;\/a&gt; for the better part of the year, even inspiring an executive order back in May.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fv9SnLFVx7\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/\"&gt;Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/embed\/#?secret=fv9SnLFVx7\" data-secret=\"fv9SnLFVx7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That executive order gets at the real reason behind Trump&amp;#8217;s ire: He believes that social media companies, Twitter in particular, have unfairly censored him. While Twitter has continued to allow Trump to remain on its platform even as he flaunts the rules, the company now limits the reach of his most dangerous or misleading tweets \u2014 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/03\/trump-tweet-steal-election-vote-by-mail\/\"&gt;false claims&lt;\/a&gt; about the election results, for example \u2014 and pairs them with warning labels.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, if Trump got his way, an outright repeal of Section 230 would open online platforms to an insurmountable level of legal liability, either sinking social media companies outright or forcing them to severely restrict their users&amp;#8217; speech.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s possible that the president could dig his heels in, pushing the defense spending bill into President-elect Biden&amp;#8217;s term.

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; said Wednesday that accounts protected with a hardware security key can now log in from their iPhone or Android device.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The social media giant rolled out support for hardware security keys in 2018, allowing users to add a physical security barrier to their accounts in place of other two-factor authentication options, like a text message or a code generated from an app.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Security keys are small enough to fit on a keyring but make certain kinds of account hacks near impossible by requiring a user to plug in the key when they log in. That means hackers on the other side of the planet &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/google-data-two-factor-security\/\"&gt;can&amp;#8217;t easily break into your account&lt;\/a&gt;, even if they have your username and password.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jcmi\/status\/1197649884645511168?s=20\"&gt;technical limitations&lt;\/a&gt; meant that accounts protected with security keys could only log in from a computer, and not a mobile device.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twitter solved that headache in part by &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/engineering\/en_us\/topics\/infrastructure\/2019\/webauthn.html\"&gt;switching to the WebAuthn protocol&lt;\/a&gt; last year, which paved the way for bringing hardware security key support to more devices and browsers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now anyone with a security key set up on their Twitter account can use that same key to log in from their mobile device, so long as the key is supported. (A ton of security keys exist today that work across different devices, like &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/yubico-reveals-new-yubikey\/\"&gt;YubiKeys&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/05\/google-opentitan-secure-chip\/\"&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s Titan key&lt;\/a&gt;.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twitter \u2014 and other companies \u2014 have long recommended that high-profile accounts, like journalists, politicians and government officials, use security keys to prevent some of the more sophisticated attacks. Twitter explains how to set up two-factor authentication (and security keys) &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/managing-your-account\/two-factor-authentication\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year Twitter rolled out hardware security keys to its own staff to prevent a repeat of its July cyberattack that saw hackers break into the company&amp;#8217;s internal network and &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/15\/twitter-hacker-admin-scam\/\"&gt;abuse an &amp;#8220;admin&amp;#8221; tool&lt;\/a&gt;, which the hackers then used to hijack high-profile accounts to spread a cryptocurrency scam.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the attack, Twitter hired &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/twitter-ciso-rinki-sethi\/\"&gt;Rinki Sethi&lt;\/a&gt; as its new chief information security officer, and famed hacker Peiter Zatko, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/24\/decrypted-apple-facebook-privacy-mudge-zero-day\/\"&gt;known as Mudge&lt;\/a&gt;, as the company&amp;#8217;s head of security.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed breakout\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"e0BfzCWXsr\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/24\/decrypted-apple-facebook-privacy-mudge-zero-day\/\"&gt;Decrypted: Apple and Facebook&amp;#8217;s privacy feud, Twitter hires Mudge, mysterious zero-days&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&amp;#8220;Decrypted: Apple and Facebook&amp;#8217;s privacy feud, Twitter hires Mudge, mysterious zero-days&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/24\/decrypted-apple-facebook-privacy-mudge-zero-day\/embed\/#?secret=e0BfzCWXsr\" data-secret=\"e0BfzCWXsr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Twitter said Wednesday that accounts protected with a hardware security key can now log in from their iPhone or Android device.

help legacy fintech players compete with their more nimble digital counterparts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company, which spun out from the startup lending company Avant in January of this year, has already inked deals with &lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Banco P&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;opular,&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; HSBC,

looking for resources and infrastructure to accelerate their digital strategy and meet the demands of today\u2019s consumer,\u201d said Jade Mandel, a vice president in Goldman Sachs&amp;#8217; growth equity platform, GS Growth, who will be joining the board of directors at Amount, in a statement. \u201cAmount enables banks to navigate digital transformation through its modular and mobile-first platform for financial products. We\u2019re excited to partner with the team as they take on this compelling market opportunity.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Complementing those customer-facing services is a deep expertise in fraud prevention on the back-end to help banks provide more loans with less risk than competitors, according to chief executive Adam Hughes.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the combination of these three services that led Goldman to take point on a new $81 million investment in the company, with participation from previous investors &lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;August Capital, Invus Opportunities and Hanaco Ventures&lt;\/span&gt; &amp;#8212; giving Amount a post-money valuation of $681 million and bringing the company&amp;#8217;s total capital raised in 2020 to a whopping $140 million.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Think of &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amount\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amount\"&gt;Amount &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; as a white-labeled digital banking service provider for Luddite banks that hadn&amp;#8217;t upgraded their services to keep pace with demands of a new generation of customers or the COVID-19 era of digital-first services for everything.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bank-3cdc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bank-3cdc\"&gt;Banks &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; pay a pretty penny for access to Amount&amp;#8217;s services. On top of a percentage for any loans that a bank processes through Amount&amp;#8217;s services, there&amp;#8217;s an up-front implementation fee that typically averages at $1 million.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hefty price tag is a sign of how concerned banks are about their digital challengers. Hughes said that they&amp;#8217;ve seen a big uptick in adoption since the launch of their buy-now-pay-later product designed to compete with the fast growing startups like &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/affirm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"affirm\"&gt;Affirm &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/klarna\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"klarna\"&gt;Klarna &lt;span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, by offering banks these services, Amount gives Klarna and Affirm something to worry about. That&amp;#8217;s because banks conceivably have a lower cost of capital than the startups and can offer better rates to borrowers. They also have the balance sheet capacity to approve more loans than either of the two upstart lenders.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;\u00a0\u201cAmount has the wind at its back and the industry is taking notice,\u201d said Nigel Morris, the co-founder of Capital One and an investor in Amount through the firm QED Investors. \u201cThe latest round brings Amount\u2019s total capital raised in 2020 to nearly $140 million, which will provide for additional investments in platform research and development while accelerating the company\u2019s go-to-market strategy. QED is thrilled to be a part of Amount\u2019s story and we look forward to the company\u2019s future success as it plays a vital role in the digitization of financial services.\u201d&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;FT Partners served as advisor to Amount on this transaction.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Amount, a new service that helps traditional banks compete in a digital world, has raised $81 million from none other than Goldman Sachs as it looks to help legacy fintech players compete with their more nimble digital counterparts.
