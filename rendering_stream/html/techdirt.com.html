<p>
This always seemed like the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201119/14101345740/white-house-offers-to-allow-renaming-confederate-bases-exchange-getting-rid-section-230.shtml">the most likely outcome</a>, but Trump had complicated things with his temper tantrum <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201201/00522745793/white-house-still-pushing-to-slip-section-230-repeal-into-must-pass-military-spending-bill.shtml">demands</a> and his threat to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201201/23254145806/trump-promises-to-defund-entire-military-if-congress-wont-let-him-punish-internet-being-mean-to-him.shtml">veto the National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) if it didn't include a clause wiping out Section 230. However, Congress has come to its senses and leaders of both parties have said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/02/congress-trump-veto-threat-defense-bill-442209" target="_blank">they'll ignore his impotent veto threat</a> and move forward with the bill as is.
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
The final version of the National Defense Authorization Act that will soon be considered by the House and Senate won’t include Trump’s long-sought repeal of the legal immunity for online companies, known as Section 230, according to lawmakers and aides.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Key to this was Senate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/528388-gop-chairman-says-repeal-of-tech-shield-not-in-defense-bill-amid-veto-threat" target="_blank">pointing out the obvious</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"First of all 230 has nothing to do with the military."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
That's both first of all and last of all. The whole attempt to use the NDAA to attack CDA 230 was just bizarre.
</p>
<p>
Inhofe did say he still thinks that 230 should go, but not as a part of the NDAA. A few other Republicans are finally speaking up as well.
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
Still, Republicans on Wednesday showed some signs of exasperation with the president’s latest effort. As one GOP lawmaker put it: “Republicans are sick of this shit.”
</p>
<p>
Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, put it more delicately. While he said he understood the president’s frustrations with Section 230, it was not worth imperiling the broader defense bill.
</p>
<p>
“The NDAA is so important to the men and women that wear the uniform that this should not be an item to veto the act over,” he said. “So I would hope he would reconsider his position on it.”
</p>
<p>
And Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said his “preference” would be to pass the NDAA and then address Section 230 separately.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Democratic critics of Section 230 were equally as annoyed. Remember, Senator Richard Blumenthal has been one of the most vocal critics of Section 230 going back to the time before he was a Senator and when he was stymied in trying to sue Craigslist by Section 230 (he was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080328/164111692.shtml">upset</a> that sex workers use Craigslist, and wanted to blame Craigslist for the fact that sex workers exist).
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a co-sponsor of the only bipartisan bill targeting Section 230 to advance out of committee this Congress, called the veto threat "deeply dangerous and just plain stupid.”
</p>
<p>
He added, “Reforming Section 230 deserves its own debate — one that I’ve helped lead in Congress, and which I look forward to continuing with a more serious, thoughtful administration in January.”
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
In another article, Rep. Frank Pallone <a href="https://www.protocol.com/trumps-section-230-veto-threat" target="_blank">stated the obvious</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone said in a statement that Trump is "holding a critical defense bill hostage in a petulant attempt to punish Twitter for fact-checking him. Our military and national security should not suffer just because Trump's ego was bruised."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
There is still plenty of appetite to attack Section 230. And there will be lots of dumb fights about it, but it's not going down this way.

<b>Summary: </b>The Proud Boys, a group with a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/30/who-proud-boys-group-mentioned-debate-has-violent-history/5868406002/">history of violent interactions</a>, often in support of Donald Trump, received prominent attention during the first Presidential debate of 2020 between Trump and Joe Biden. Upon being asked about whether or not he would condemn white supremacist groups that support him, Trump asked for an example. When given The Proud Boys, Trump told them to “stand back and stand by,” which many in the group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-proud-boys-biden.html">took to be an endorsement</a> of their activities.

While the group has long denied that its views are racist, the group has long said that it is based around “<a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/10/07/proud-boys-explained/">Western chauvinism</a>” and has been repeatedly associated with violence and white supremacist groups and individuals. Both <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/alt-right-group-the-proud-boys-suspended-from-twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/facebook-proud-boys-mcinnes-kicked-off/">Facebook</a> banned the group in 2018.
</p>
<p>
However, after they received renewed attention at the 2020 debate, actor George Takei <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/1311791729767526400">suggested</a> “reclaiming” the #ProudBoys hashtag, and using it to promote the LGBTQ community instead, saying that they could respond to hate with love.

<p>
This made the hashtag <a href="https://www.advocate.com/people/2020/10/05/proud-boys-infuriated-gay-love-flooding-its-twitter-hashtag">go viral on a variety of platforms</a>, including Twitter and Instagram (owned by Facebook). In response Facebook was <a href="https://twitter.com/stonecold2050/status/1313180165468426241">accused</a> (incorrectly) of only just blocking the hashtag after this attempt at reclaiming. However, Facebook exec Andy Stone <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1313267304688504834">noted</a> that the opposite was true, and that Facebook was currently in the process of <em>unbanning </em>the hashtag after seeing how it had been reclaimed, and the meaning and usage changed.

<p>
<b>Decisions to be made by Facebook:</b>
</p><ul><li>Is banning an entire hashtag appropriate?</li><li>When do you ban a hashtag associated with violence and bigotry?</li><li>How do you decide when to reverse such a ban, if the hashtag has been “reclaimed” by groups seeking to promote counter-messaging?</li><li>How do you avoid having that unbanned hashtag abused again at a later date?</li></ul>
<b>Questions and policy implications to consider:</b>
<ul><li>How do you create policies for situations that may change over time?</li><li>How do you handle situations in which the meanings of words and terms may change as other people make use of them?</li><li>Will banning hashtags or phrases act to prevent this kind of bottom up behavior?</li></ul>
<b>Resolution: </b>By moving quickly, Facebook and Instagram were able to relatively quickly allow for this viral response to reclaim the hashtag from the group. However, it remains an open question whether or not this usage will stay, or if the group will move to reclaim it as well, creating a constant cat &amp; mouse scenario for a content moderation team.

It's not just American law enforcement agencies turning kids into criminals. They're doing it in Australia too. In Florida, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office uses software to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201120/17545845746/florida-sheriffs-pre-crime-software-says-d-students-victims-domestic-violence-are-potential-criminals.shtml">mark kids as budding criminals</a>, using questionable markers like D-grades, witnessing domestic violence, or being the victim of a crime. The spreadsheet adds it all up and gives deputies a thumbs up to start treating students like criminals, even if they've never committed a criminal act.
</p>
<p>
Over in Australia, the process seems to be a bit more rigorous, but the outcome is the same: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/23/victoria-police-refuses-to-reveal-how-many-young-people-tracked-using-secretive-data-tool">non-criminals marked (possibly for life) as potential criminals who should be targeted with more law enforcement intervention</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Victorian police say a secretive data tool that tracked youths and predicted the risk they would commit crime is not being widely used, amid fears it leads to young people from culturally diverse backgrounds being disproportionately targeted.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>The tool, which had been used in Dandenong and surrounding suburbs, was only revealed in interviews with police officers published earlier this year.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Between 2016 and 2018, police categorised young people as “youth network offenders” or “core youth network offenders”.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It takes a bit more to be added to this secret list -- one police have managed to keep hidden from the general public. Even the program's name remains a secret. This means parents are never informed when cops decide their kids are criminals-in-development. It also possibly means schools aren't aware the data they're feeding the police is being used this way.
</p>
<p>
According to the research paper detailing the program, Victoria police have classified 40-60 students as "core youth network offenders." Another 240 students were classified as "youth network offenders." To get placed on these exclusive lists, students must be charged dozens of times with "offenses," running from 20 for the 10-14-year-old group to over 60 for 18-year-olds. It's unclear from the context of the report whether this means criminal offenses or in-school discipline "offenses," but the latter seems more likely. Someone criminally charged over 60 times before they reached the age of 18 wouldn't need to be on a secret youth offender list to be on law enforcement's radar.
</p>
<p>
The Victoria police appear to believe the tech is actually magic.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>“We can run that tool now and it will tell us – like the kid might be 15 – it tells how many crimes he is going to commit before he is 21 based on that, and it is a 95% accuracy,” one senior officer told [researchers]. “It has been tested.</em>”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actual pre-crime, stripped of all the obfuscating language that normally surrounds statements on profiling/predictive policing programs. This program can actually predict criminal acts… at least according to its proponents and users. Presumably the police aren't locking up listed students ahead of any wrongdoing, but they're certainly increasing their interactions and surveillance of students the tool said will commit [x] crimes over the next few years.
</p>
<p>
And, like every goddamn <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200324/13574044162/eu-parliament-told-predictive-policing-software-relies-dirty-data-generated-corrupt-cops.shtml">predictive policing program</a> that exists anywhere, it focuses on minorities and other disadvantaged residents.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>In Dandenong, 67% of households spoke a language other than English at home, more than three times the national average, according to the 2016 census. Almost 80% of all residents had parents who were both born overseas, more than double the national average.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>The weekly household income was $412 less than the Australian median, and the unemployment rate of 13% was almost double the national figure.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Cheer up. The cops are here to take everything that sucks about life and make it worse. Rather than address the underlying problems, law enforcement appears content to throw a spreadsheet over it and divert resources towards subjecting certain people to a lifetime of harassment. Then, when things inevitably get worse, they can ask for more money to buy more "smart" policing tech garbage that ensures this hideous, regressive loop remains unbroken.

U.S legislators have drawn a bizarre line in the sand when exploring the invasive nature of technology companies and personal rights to privacy.
</p>
<p>
In Washington, D.C. there are <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200730/01174945007/house-judiciary-spends-55-hours-making-themselves-look-foolish-without-asking-many-actual-tough-questions-tech-ceos.shtml">regular hearings</a> about the potential harms that “big tech” companies can cause because they have so much access to so much information. Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon testified before Congressional Subcommittees about their business practices, their data sharing between their own businesses, and the way that information gets used in relation to competition. What’s interesting about that, though, is the fact no consumer can share their personal information directly with any of them.
</p>
<p>
In order to reach any of the Big Tech companies that are generating immense amounts of policy discussion these days, a person must first have access to an internet service provider (ISP). This could be your home wireline connection from companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast, Frontier, Charter/Spectrum or a litany of other providers. It could also be your mobile service provider if you use a smartphone to browse the internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who Sees What Data?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The big tech companies have historically obtained the majority of the data they have because people elected to use the services. Amazon knows your buying habits because they track what you order. Google knows what ads to show because it tracked what searches you were making. The ISPs, though, have a unique position in that they facilitate the connection between you and those edge services. They not only know that you elected to go to Google to perform a search, they also know that from that Google search, you then clicked a link and navigated to another website. While Google’s reach can be pretty extensive with the ability to track behavior from a search or any click on an ad that they provide, an ISP doesn’t need that secondary interaction. They know where you go online because they facilitate the connection between you and that end point.
</p>
<p>
There are ways to protect yourself against ISPs monitoring how munch they can see. First, HTTPS encrypts a lot of the actual data being transferred. This means that unless the website is encrypting DNS itself, the only thing the ISP might know is what websites you’re choosing to visit. You can also use a virtual private network (VPN). If you choose to do that, then the ISP will see only that you are connecting from your location to the secondary location. This allows you to mask your location to websites because all of the bidirectional browser traffic is between the websites and the secondary location you’ve tunneled into where the VPN is located.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Internet is More than Browser Traffic</strong>
</p>
<p>
The problem with many of the policy considerations regarding how to protect consumers when so much of their data is accessible is that it repeatedly falls short. Think about all the devices in your life that connect to the internet. These include your phone, tablet, and laptop along with all of the ancillary devices – lights, outlets, home assistants, robot vacuums, and even the infamous toaster - that make up the world of the Internet of Things (IoT). These IoT devices require similar connectivity as your computer or phone, but without many of the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180604/07134939961/yet-another-study-shows-internet-things-is-privacy-security-dumpster-fire.shtml">security and safety measures</a> in place.
</p>
<p>
IoT functions relatively simply. There is a sensor that connects to the network in order to communicate its status to a processor. When the sensor’s status changes, it sends that single to a processor. From there, the processor determines what that sensor’s status change means and sends out a command over the network to an actuator that performs a task. Consider the following example: You pull into your driveway, your house recognizes that you’re there and it opens your garage door, adjusts the temperature, turns on lights, starts your favorite evening playlist. Maybe it even brews you a fresh cup of decaf so you can kick off your shoes and settle in for whatever comes next.
</p>
<p>
That’s one sensor using merely the presence of your device to trigger a communication with the processor. That processor then reaches out over the network and provides commands for services provided by potentially five different manufacturers – the garage door controller, the thermostat, the lights, your preferred streaming music service, and your coffee pot. How much information has an ISP just potentially learned about you with you typing a single character?
</p>
<p>
They know that someone arrived home at that specific time because the sensor communicated over the network to the control processor. They know that you have each of those devices in your home provided by each of those manufacturers. They know what streaming music service you prefer.
</p>
<p>
Some of that information might seem innocuous. Who cares if the ISP knows what coffee maker you have? Why does it matter if the ISP knows what time you got home? Everyone is going to have to get home at some point in time, aren’t they?
</p>
<p>
The value of an ISP being able to monitor that kind of information is not in the snapshot of one instance. Yes, they can use that information to help third-parties better target where they sell ads for your browsing behavior. The real value, though, is that these ISPs know what devices are connecting to your home, and that they can trace your habits and behavioral patterns from that information.
</p>
<p>
If you habitually arrive at home around that specific time each day, the ISP can track that information. If that data shows that every Thursday there’s no command, but there’s increased traffic from your home, the ISP can reasonably conclude that those are the days that you work from home. They might be able to glean that information from just the increased traffic, but the missing command when you arrive home gives them more verifiable data about your habits and practices.
</p>
<p>
Your next thought, after reconsidering the position that the data isn’t that important might be to conclude that you have some protections to under United States privacy laws from an ISP monitoring your behavior online. Except, you'd be wrong.
</p>
<p>
<strong>ISPs Broadening Their Reach</strong>
</p>
<p>
This may not concern you, personally, because you figure there isn’t enough data there to be harmful. However, not everyone is a sophisticated tech user. Some people, would rather have one company provide them all of their smart tech and have that company manage it. This is the landscape we’re starting to find ourselves in today.
</p>
<p>
Comcast not only offers cable and internet to homes, they also offer <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/home-security/devices">security systems</a> including cameras, window and door sensors, and more. They even tout the capabilities of being compatible with numerous smart home devices like door locks, thermostats, and lighting. <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/browse/smart-home">AT&amp;T is no different</a>, offering to sell streaming media players, smart outlets, security cameras, and both Google or Amazon devices as the control.
</p>
<p>
The ISPs do not care what devices you connect to your network. In theory, any device should work just as well as any other. Though, given the repeal of federal net neutrality regulations. The ISPs have positioned themselves in the perfect spot to pick preferred vendors. Essentially, while they won’t state it openly, if you buy the products that they sell, now they know exactly what’s in your home, and you have an extra bit of confidence that it will work reliably, without any blocking or throttling, because you bought it from the service provider. This creates an advantage for any company willing to open up your information to the ISP because there’s a self-serving benefit. Provide more data to the ISP-reseller about the user and how the device is used and you’ll be included in the preferred vendor list.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ties to Title II</strong>
</p>
<p>
It seems almost everything that has to do with telecom these days has to do with the net neutrality and reclassification battle, and the ability of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to make privacy rules is no different. The ability of the FCC to promulgate privacy regulation turns on the same point in the 1996 Telecommunications Act as net neutrality.
</p>
<p>
If telecommunications are classified as a Title I service, then they are subject to 47 U.S.C. §160 which states,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"...the Commission shall forbear from applying any regulation…if the Commission determines that (1) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulation by, for, or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or…service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; (2) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and (3) forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
All this to say that the FCC, while having authority to make rules that govern privacy regulations under the Telecommunications Act has to deem that it’s required to do so. If the services are classified as Title I, then they lack the authority to regulate.
</p>
<p>
Even if the FCC was to consider acting, the ISPs could file petitions seeking that the FCC forebear from taking action. Once that petition is filed, then the FCC has one year to respond, with the ability to extend by 90 days under certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Under a Title II classification, the FCC has broad authority to act and regulate.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is no forbearance consideration required to be made, though one can still be petitioned.
</p>
<p>
In 2015, when the FCC reclassified broadband as a Title II service, it set up circumstances for greater broadband rules. It even passed privacy rules for broadband interactive service providers. However, when the current FCC passed the Restoring Internet Freedom Order (RIFO), it undid the Title II classification, returning broadband services to a Title I classification. As such, broadband is again outside the regulatory authority of the FCC.
</p>
<p>
While the logical conclusion, then, might be to restore the 2015 Open Internet Order, that would be incorrect. The 2015 order carved out specific exceptions for non-BIAS (Broadband Internet Access Services) that included devices like heart monitors, e-readers, energy consumption sensors, or other limited-purpose devices such as automobile telematics and scholastic applications providing content in schools. This was not an exhaustive list and, based on the type of communication involved, most if not all IoT devices would likely fall into this same gap. This means that even with a Title II reclassification, IoT would remain outside the protections.
</p>
<p>
The California net neutrality law does a little better in potentially offering some protection in that it focuses its efforts on the behavior of the ISPs when it comes to blocking, throttling, or forcing paid prioritization for the devices on a network. However, the emphasis of the devices needing to be non-harmful may defeat any IoT protections because nowhere in the bill did it define what a non-harmful device was. Considering the <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2019/10/iot-security-or-the-lack-there-of/">lack of security measures</a> and <a href="https://www.a10networks.com/blog/iot-and-ddos-cyberattacks-rise/">the common use of IoT in botnet or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks</a>, it may be difficult to confidently state that the devices are non-harmful.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Federal Privacy laws</strong>
</p>
<p>
In October 2016, the FCC passed <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-16-148A1.pdf">new privacy rules</a> that required the ISPs to get their customers to opt-in to before the data that the ISPs acquired was shared with third parties. The scope of information, as defined by the FCC was the, “statutory definition of customer proprietary network information (CPNI),” meaning, “individually identifiable CPNI, personally identifiable information (PII), and content of communications.”
</p>
<p>
Even examining those terms, it’s still difficult to see how IoT would have seen any coverage. Perhaps an argument could have been made for devices that were tracking personal health information, but it’s hard to say what identifiable information could be gained from an individual IoT device that raises and lowers a garage door. In aggregate it’s a different story, but that would have required the ISPs to be collating the data to sell in a package about a consumer household, which may have been deemed a violation of the rules, or to be doing it themselves.
</p>
<p>
It’s a moot point, though, because a few short months after the rules were passed, when Congress went into session at the beginning of 2017, they utilized <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43992.pdf">the Congressional Review Act</a> to repeal the rules. This had two effects. First, it treated the rules as though they had never taken effect. (See 5 U.S.C. §801(f)). The second, and arguably more important part, this disapproval resolution made it so that the FCC could not reissue privacy rules in “substantially the same form” nor could they issue a “new rule that is substantially the same…unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.” (See 5 U.S.C. §801(b)(2).
</p>
<p>
What this means is that the federal agency tasked with overseeing communications by wire and the companies that operate in that space have now been specifically restricted from enacting any kind of rulemaking in regards to how those companies gather, store, and share data from their customers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>State Privacy Laws</strong>
</p>
<p>
To date, there are <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/state-comparison-table/">only three states that have passed consumer privacy laws</a> – California, Maine, and Nevada. There are several other states that either have bills in process or have assembled task forces in lieu of a comprehensive privacy bill. Since there is only a small offering of laws, it’s worth taking a look at the contents to each bill to see if they cover ISP activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>California</strong>: The <a href="https://theccpa.org/#1798.140">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA) applies to any business that has annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million, or that annually deals with personal information from 50,000 or more households in California, or that gets 50% or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers’ personal information. The larger ISPs will certainly fall under the first category and would likely be subject to the second as well.
</p>
<p>
Where this hits the IoT space would be Section 1798.135(o)(1)(F) which covers “Internet or other electronic network activity information, including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement.” Alternatively, Section 1798.135(o)(1)(K) includes “Interferences drawn from any of the information in this subdivision to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there’s a strange loophole. The CCPA does not protect “consumer information that is deidentified or aggregate consumer information.” (See Section 1798.135(o)(3)). This seems to means that if the ISP is able to piece little bits of deidentified data together to offer a more comprehensive view, then it’s not in violation of the CCPA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Maine</strong>: The Maine legislature went a different direction with their <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0275&amp;item=9&amp;snum=129">privacy law</a> when it passed the Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy. Instead of focusing on the edge service providers collecting data, Maine’s law specifically targets the ISPs. The key points in relation to IoT are §9301(1)(C)(g), protecting “The customer’s device identifier, such as a media access control address, international mobile equipment identity or Internet protocol (IP) address;” and §9301(1)(C)(i) covering “The origin and destination Internet protocol addresses.”
</p>
<p>
In order for the IoT devices to communicate with other devices on the network or “phone home” and provide data to the manufacturer they have to have an IP address. For the device to provide useful information to the ISP, it would need to know the destination where the device was communication – the destination IP address. Both are protected under the law.
</p>
<p>
Much of the Maine law is what the FCC rules tried to implement before being subject to the disapproval resolution from Congress.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nevada</strong>: The <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-603A.html#NRS603ASec030">Nevada law</a> has the most limited protections of the three enacted laws. It only protects personal information if it includes first initial or name and the last name along with either a social security number; or driver’s license or identification card number; or a bank or credit card number with the required security code or password to provide financial account access; or medial identification or health insurance identification number; or “a user name, unique identifier, or email address in combination with a password, access code or security question and answer permitting access to an online account.”
</p>
<p>
This law is useful from the perspective of keeping personal account information secured, but the sensor and actuator data that IoT is dealing with is well outside of the protections.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
Other than the Maine privacy law and the CCPA, it seems as though there are no privacy laws in the
United States that act to protect the information that an ISP can gather, sell, or share with third parties. They can capture your browser data, but in addition to that, the majority of the privacy laws that have been written only examine browsing behavior and ignore the device-to-device communication involved with IoT.
</p>
<p>
The lack of net neutrality regulations means that the ISPs can also treat all data types differently. This means that they can examine the source of the data transmissions and determine if they want to block, throttle or force the device maker or owner to pay more to transmit that data without interruption. It also means that that the ISPs are in a position to pick preferential business partners in the IoT marketplace.
</p>
<p>
If the manufacturer is willing to share data with the ISP, then their transmissions will go uninterrupted. This can disadvantage any real competition between device manufacturers, all under the name of “proper network management practices.”
</p>
<p>
Finally, it means that even though you are not actively providing information to edge service providers by using the internet, your devices are still providing a lot of data about the ways in which you live. Anyone with access to that information can collate it, determine your common behavioral patterns (even if you are offline), discover your preferred service providers, and then package and share that information.
</p>
<p>
Considering the degree to which an ISP can monitor your behavior, it’s pretty incredible that somehow the large ISPs have managed to avoid any public scrutiny while Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are subject to complaints from Congress, and now pending <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201020/09563045541/bill-barrs-google-antitrust-inquiry-is-weaponized-farce.shtml">antitrust litigation</a>.

<h3>from the <i>do-not-pass-go,-do-not-collect-$200</i> dept</h3><div class="byline"><span class="pub_date">Wed, Dec 2nd 2020 10:50am</span> —
<a href="/user/kbode">Karl Bode</a></div>
<p>
Last week, we noted how Comcast had expanded its bullshit broadband usage caps during a pandemic, insisting that the confusing, technically-unnecessary restrictions were being deployed in an alleged act of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201123/07280445757/comcast-expands-bullshit-usage-capsin-middle-pandemic.shtml">fairness</a>. Of course as we noted, there's nothing "fair" about costly, punitive surcharges that serve absolutely no technical purpose, and exist exclusively so a monopoly can extract additional revenue from monopolized markets and captive subscribers with no alternative ISPs to choose from.
</p>
<p>
But Comcast's not just using usage caps to extract its pound of flesh. The company is raising prices across <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/11/comcast-raising-tv-and-internet-prices-including-a-big-hike-to-hidden-fees/">most of its services just before the new year</a>, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/jyi9nd/another_comcast_price_hike/">significant price hikes</a> for its TV services, broadband services, and hardware rental costs. Comcast will also be increasing a bevy of misleading fees, including another $4.50 per month for the company's "Broadcast TV Fee," which is simply some of the cost of programming broken out and hidden below the line, so that the company can falsely advertise a lower rate than you'll see on your final bill:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"Other changes for 2021 include a Broadcast TV Fee increase of up to $4.50 depending on the market; $3 increase for Internet-only service; and up to a $2.50 increase for TV boxes on the primary outlet, with a decrease of up to $2.45 for TV boxes on additional outlets," the Comcast spokesperson added. The fee for a customer's primary TV box is rising from $5 to $7.50, while the fee for additional boxes is being lowered from $9.95 to $7.50."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Comcast isn't engaged in any meaningful network upgrade projects to necessitate such notable price hikes, so this is simply a monopoly raising prices on its services, including an essential utility, during an historic health and economic crisis.
</p>
<p>
And of course Comcast can get away with this for two reasons. One, roughly 83 million Americans live under a <a href="https://ilsr.org/report-most-americans-have-no-real-choice-in-internet-providers/">broadband monopoly</a> (usually Comcast), so there's no place for these customers to flee to. And despite a lot of chippy, feel good talk about the "digital divide" being his top priority, Trump FCC boss Ajit Pai is a feckless bureaucrat who has never had the backbone to stand up to this industry on any issue of real substance. Pai hasn't made so much as a peep as a major US broadband provider imposes major new additional costs in the middle of a pandemic crisis in which broadband in an essential lifeline.
</p>
<p>
You'd think the obvious one-two punch of limited competition and regulatory capture would drive US policy makers to action. Instead, most US policymakers spend their days either pretending there is no telecom monopolization problem, or engaging in performative histrionics over "censorship" by "big tech monopolies." Having just effectively convinced the Trump FCC to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190611/13180142374/heres-why-net-neutrality-still-matters-one-year-after-repeal.shtml">neuter itself at lobbyist behest</a>, the US government is in a weaker position than ever when it comes to standing up to telecom monopolies or protecting already struggling Americans from a telecom monopolization problem we often refuse to even acknowledge, much less fix.

<p>
President Trump has continued to throw his little temper tantrum in response to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201130/01180645786/just-as-diaperdon-starts-trending-trump-claims-that-twitter-uses-fake-trends-calls-termination-section-230.shtml">#DiaperDon trending on Twitter</a>. When that happened, he suddenly demanded a full repeal of Section 230 -- which <b>would not stop Twitter</b> from showing #DiaperDon trending when the President throws a temper tantrum like a 2 year old. Then, yesterday, we heard that the White House was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201201/00522745793/white-house-still-pushing-to-slip-section-230-repeal-into-must-pass-military-spending-bill.shtml">really pushing</a> for the Senate to include a 230 repeal in the must pass NDAA bill that <b>funds the military</b>.
</p>
<p>
Late last evening I heard from people in touch with various Congressional offices saying that this entire effort by the White House was dead in the water, because almost no one had an appetite to even try to attempt it, and despite the whackadoodle conspiracy theories from the President and Senators Ted Cruz, Marsha Blackburn, and Josh Hawley, it turns out that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't care about 230 reform.
</p>
<p>
Of course, even later last night, things took an even stupider turn, as Trump declared on Twitter that unless the NDAA included a full repeal of Section 230, he would veto it. This is all sorts of stupid and we'll break it all down in a moment, so bear with me.
</p>

<p>
That says:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to “Big Tech” (the only companies in America that have it - corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security &amp; Election Integrity. Our Country can never be safe &amp; secure if we allow it to stand..... Therefore, if the very dangerous &amp; unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk. Take back America NOW. Thank you!
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
We'll get into why nearly everything in that statement is wrong, dangerous, and stupid, but I want to be crystal clear about what is happening here.
</p>
<p>
<b>President Donald J. Trump is threatening to <u>defund the US military</u>, because he's upset that enough people mocked him on Twitter that it started trending.</b>
</p>
<p>
That's it. That's the reality. This is the world we live in. And it's so insane, it needs to be repeated.
</p>
<p>
<b>President Donald J. Trump is threatening to <u>defund the US military</u>, because he's upset that enough people mocked him on Twitter that it started trending.</b>
</p>
<p>
Oh, and it's even stupider. On so many levels. First off, taking away Section 230 wouldn't stop #DiaperDon from trending on Twitter, because that's protected by the 1st Amendment and has nothing to do with Section 230. If anything, it would give much more incentive for Twitter <b>to remove Donald Trump and his followers accounts entirely</b> to avoid the suddenly increased legal liability.
</p>
<p>
But, now, let's take a deep breath, take a step back, and look at how incredibly stupid Trump's statement is.
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to “Big Tech” (the only companies in America that have it - corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security &amp; Election Integrity.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
None of this is even close to reality. This is pure nonsense. Section 230 <b>applies to all websites</b> for any 3rd party content they host. The claim that "big tech" are the only companies that have it is belied by this simple point: Donald Trump himself has <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2020/06/president-trump-loves-section-230-for-himself-just-not-for-anyone-else-guest-blog-post.htm" target="_blank">invoked Section 230</a> in court. Multiple times. Incredibly, in 2017, he argued that he shouldn't be liable for the content of a retweet he did, because of Section 230. In fact, in court, Trump argued that Section 230 "should be given an 'expansive' reading" in order to protect himself from defamation claims. He's right. Section 230 should protect him in those cases, but it also highlights how it's absolutely bullshit to claim that it only protects "Big Tech" and that big tech companies are "the only companies in America that have it." It's just not true.
</p>
<p>
As for the claim that Section 230 is a "threat to our National Security," let's play a little thought exercise: <em>which is a bigger threat to our national security: a law that says internet websites are not liable for the actions of their users <b>or</b> defunding the entire military?</em> I'll give you a minute to think about it.
</p>
<p>
Because here's the point where I remind you that <b>President Donald J. Trump is threatening to <u>defund the US military</u>, because he's upset that enough people mocked him on Twitter that it started trending.</b>
</p>
<p>
Oh, and then there's the claim about "election integrity" and... what? What the fuck does election integrity have to do with Section 230? The answer is <b>absolutely nothing</b>. He's just spewing words.
</p>
<p>
I could go on, but it's all just incredibly stupid. It's one thing to say that Trump is an blundering fool, but here is a legitimate threat to national security, entirely because people are making fun of him. It's frightening beyond all belief.
</p>
<p>
And this is the point that in a <b>functioning</b> Congress, <b>everyone</b> would stand up to the President and say "no, this is not how this works." Congressional Republicans need to stop enabling this utterly dangerous nonsense. Because <b>President Donald J. Trump is threatening to <u>defund the US military</u>, because he's upset that enough people mocked him on Twitter that it started trending.</b> That should not be allowed to happen.

<p>
Section 230 has become a mainstream discussion topic, but unfortunately many discussants don’t actually understand it well (or at all). To address this knowledge gap, co-editors Profs. Eric Goldman (Santa Clara Law) and Jeff Kosseff (U.S. Naval Academy) have released an ebook, called “Zeran v. America Online,” addressing many aspects of Section 230. You can download the ebook for free at:

<p>
Zeran v. AOL is the most important Section 230 case of all time. The Zeran case was the first federal appellate decision interpreting Section 230, and its breathtakingly broad sweep turbocharged the rise of Web 2.0–with all of its strengths and weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
In recognition of Zeran’s importance, in 2017, Profs. Goldman and Kosseff helped assemble an essay package to honor the case’s 20th anniversary. They gathered two dozen essays from some of the most knowledgeable Section 230 experts. The essays address the case’s history and policy implications. Initially, Law.com published the essay package but then unexpectedly paywalled the essays after 6 months.
</p>
<p>
The new Zeran v. America Online ebook restores the 2017 essay package into a new and easy-to-read format. Together, they are a great entry point into the debates about Section 230, including how we got here and what’s at stake.
</p>
<p>
To supplement the essay package, the ebook compiles an archive of the key documents in the Zeran v. AOL litigation (with bonus coverage of Zeran’s case against radio station KRXO). Many of these materials have not previously been publicly available in electronic format. The case archives should be of interest both to historians and students of precedent-setting litigation tactics.
</p>
<p>
Section 230 will likely remain hotly debated, but the debates won’t be productive until we develop a shared understanding of what the law says and why. Ideally, this ebook will advance those goals.

<h3>from the <i>of-course-it's-a-'national-security'-thing</i> dept</h3><div class="byline"><span class="pub_date">Wed, Dec 2nd 2020 3:33am</span> —

<p>
For reasons only known to legislators who apparently had their ears bent to the point of detachment by law enforcement, the French government -- at least briefly -- believed the nation would be better secured if citizens weren't allowed to film police officers and publish those recordings online.
</p>
<p>
A bill passed through the general assembly <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/30/french-government-drops-draft-law-curbing-filming-of-police">that would have made this act a crime</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>One of its most controversial elements was Article 24, which sought to criminalise the publication of images of on-duty police officers with the intent of harming their “physical or psychological integrity”.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Under the article, offenders faced sentences of up to a year in jail and fines of 45,000 euros ($53,760) for sharing images of police officers</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sounds like an effort to prevent doxxing but, given the breadth of the language in the proposed law, it could be read to forbid recording any officer who felt they might be harmed by their actions being documented. And it could be argued (with varying degrees of success) that <em>any </em>publication of images/recording depicting officers in any way they didn't explicitly approve of is "harmful."
</p>
<p>
And the proposal couldn't have come at a worse time. French law enforcement is facing additional scrutiny after a <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20201129-paris-prosecutor-wants-police-to-face-charges-over-beating-of-black-man-michel-zecler-brutality-security-law">recording of officers beating a black man surfaced online</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Paris's top prosecutor has called for four police officers under investigation over the beating of a black music producer to face charges and for three of them to remain in detention as the probe continues.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[...]</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>The three officers suspected of <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20201127-beating-of-black-man-fires-up-french-anger-over-law-to-protect-police-michel-zecler-darmanin-violence-loopsider">carrying out the beating</a> should remain in custody, he said, while a fourth, who arrived on the scene later and set off a tear gas canister, should be freed under conditions.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With this flame still burning, French legislators tossed this accelerant on the fire. No more documenting police activity because natsec. The citizens responded to this attempted shielding of bad cops as the French often do: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/police-paris-police-brutality-france-emmanuel-macron-27f4206b9716691e4ba4172e9b6252ac">with massive protests and a bit of violence</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Tens of thousands of critics of a proposed security law that would restrict the filming of police officers protested across France on Saturday, and officers in Paris who were advised to behave responsibly during the demonstrations repeatedly fired tear gas to disperse rowdy protesters who set fire to France’s central bank and threw paving stones.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Faced with consecutive protests (the one over the beating that rolled into the one over the proposed law), <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20201130-french-government-backtracks-over-security-law-and-right-to-film-police">French legislators are backtracking</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>France’s national assembly on Monday dropped a key provision of a controversial bill that would have curtailed the right to film police officers during their work.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em><a href="http://twitter.com/CCastaner">Christophe Castaner</a>, the head of President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling LREM party, told journalists that the bill will be scrapped and rewritten, with a new version going before parliament.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the time being, filming the police in France is still legal, even if an officer argues they've been harmed by being observed. Unfortunately, the proposal isn't completely dead. Article 24 will be revamped but it won't be until early next year. Right now, the bill is too hot to touch. A couple of months in the cooler -- and the onset of cooler weather -- might temper both protesters and belatedly irate lawmakers. If so, it could reappear mostly unchanged, especially if legislators feel the security of the nation is more important than law enforcement accountability.

<p>
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals continues to do what other circuits far too often won't: protect citizens from their government. The Ninth Circuit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200825/15095845180/when-it-comes-to-qualified-immunity-where-your-rights-were-violated-matters-more-than-fact-your-rights-were-violated.shtml">is the best place</a> to bring allegations of rights violations. It only grants immunity in 42% of cases it handles, compared to the Fifth Circuit, where cops and their qualified immunity triumph 64% of the time.
</p>
<p>
This seems to irritate the Supreme Court, which often finds itself overturning decisions bubbling up from the Ninth. But every win for Americans is another chance to establish precedent making it easier for future victims to obtain redress from courts anywhere in the nation.
</p>
<p>
This recent <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20417540/cbp-bivens.pdf">decision</a> [PDF] by the Ninth will probably once again raise the hackles of the Supreme Court. This one allows a plaintiff to sue federal officers for rights violations -- something the Supreme Court has repeatedly <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151025/09565232619/court-your-fourth-fifth-amendment-rights-no-longer-exist-if-you-leave-country.shtml">made more difficult</a> to accomplish. In 2017, the Supreme Court said non-US persons couldn't sue federal officers for violating their rights. It reinforced this decision in 2019, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200225/10294443981/supreme-court-says-ok-border-patrol-agents-to-kill-mexican-citizens-as-long-as-they-die-mexico.shtml">rejecting a lawsuit</a> brought by the family of a Mexican teen who was shot ten times by a Border Patrol agent in response to some alleged rock throwing. The Border Patrol agent was on the US side of the border. His bullets traveled across the border and into the Mexican teen, killing him in Mexico. The Supreme Court shrugged and said it was unfortunate the teen died where he did. If he had only managed to die on the US side of the border, he might have had a case.
</p>
<p>
This case doesn't end in death. But it does involve federal border security and violated rights. Here's the summary of the events leading to the lawsuit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>[Robert] Boule is a United States citizen. He owns, operates, and lives in a small bed and breakfast inn in Blaine, Washington. The back property line of the land on which the inn is located touches the United States-Canada border. On March 20, 2014, Customs and Border Patrol Agent Erik Egbert stopped Boule while he was running errands “in town” and asked him about guests staying at the inn. Boule told Egbert that he had a guest arriving that day from New York who had flown in from Turkey the day before. Boule told him that two of his employees were en route to pick up the guest at SeattleTacoma (“Sea-Tac”) International Airport, about 125 miles south of Blaine. Later that day, Egbert waited in his border patrol vehicle near the inn. The entrance to the inn is on a road at the front of the property. When the guest arrived, Egbert followed the car carrying the arriving guest into Boule’s driveway.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Egbert got out of his vehicle and approached the car. From the front porch of the inn, Boule asked Egbert to leave. When Egbert refused, Boule stepped between Egbert and the car and again asked him to leave. Boule recounts that Egbert then shoved him against the car. When Boule still did not move away from the car, Egbert grabbed him and pushed him aside and onto the ground.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Egbert then opened the car door and asked the guest about his immigration status. Boule made a 911 call to request a supervisor, which Egbert also relayed over dispatch. A supervisor and another agent arrived in response to the call. After concluding that the guest was lawfully in the country, the three officers departed. Boule later sought medical treatment for injuries to his back.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's the Fourth Amendment violation. There's also a First Amendment violation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>After Boule complained to Egbert’s superiors about the incident, Egbert retaliated against Boule. Among other things, Egbert contacted the Internal Revenue Service, asking the agency to look into Boule’s tax status.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bringing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivens_v._Six_Unknown_Named_Agents"><em>Bivens</em> case</a> against a federal officer is tricky. Federal officers are given an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity#Bivens_and_42_USC_%C2%A7_1983_lawsuits">extra level of protection</a> from lawsuits. Qualified immunity is pretty tough to dodge, given the reliance on <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200510/12185344468/reuters-report-shows-how-supreme-court-has-turned-qualified-immunity-lawsuits-into-rigged-game.shtml">(ever-decreasing) precedential rulings</a> declaring specific actions to be rights violations. In the federal context, the small crack in the immunity door disappears almost completely. More matching specifics are needed to move a case past the immunity roadblock and only certain rights violations are recognized in the <em>Bivens</em> context.
</p>
<p>
Here's how the Supreme Court sees it: allegations that fall into this broad set of variances may be considered "new" and an impermissible extension of <em>Bivens</em>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Without endeavoring to create an exhaustive list of differences that are meaningful enough to make a given context a new one . . . [:] A case might differ in a meaningful way because of the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential special factors that previous Bivens cases did not consider.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Good luck with that, plaintiffs. But this plaintiff's case will move on, greatly aided by the fact that he's a US citizen. Unlike the cases cited by the government, Boule is a legal resident of the United States. There's only one factor that separates this from other successful <em>Bivens</em> lawsuits, the court points out.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>The claim against Egbert is a conventional Fourth Amendment claim, indistinguishable from countless such claims brought against federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, except for the fact that Egbert is a border patrol agent</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The court says the fact that Egbert is a border patrol agent does not excuse him from this lawsuit, even if a comparable case involved an FBI agent. The plaintiff can continue suing Egbert over his Fourth Amendment violations.
</p>
<p>
But the court goes further, extending <em>Bivens</em> to cover both the Fourth Amendment violation and an alleged <em>First</em> Amendment violation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Boule also alleges that Egbert retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment right to complain to Egbert’s superiors about his conduct at the inn. We have previously recognized a Bivens claim in the First Amendment context, see Gibson v. United States, 781 F.2d 1334, 1342 (9th Cir. 1986), but the Supreme Court has not yet done so.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[...]</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>However, we find no special factors that counsel hesitation in extending a Bivens remedy to this new context. There is even less reason to hesitate in extending Bivens here than in the context of Boule’s Fourth Amendment claim. Retaliation is a well-established First Amendment claim, available against governmental officers in general.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And, while Egbert may find a way to prevail on the Fourth Amendment allegations by discussing the latitude granted to him as a nominal securer of the nation, he's going to have to get really creative to explain why he decided to retaliate against a citizen's protected speech.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>With respect to [the Fourth Amendment] claim, Egbert can legitimately argue that his actions at the inn were performed in connection with his official duties. He cannot say the same thing here, for his retaliation had no relation to, or justification based on, his duties as a border patrol agent.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This ruling increases the chances of success in lawsuits brought against federal agents and officers, and expands the minimal coverage to include rights violations that haven't previously been addressed in this circuit. But, because it does this, there's no chance this won't be appealed. The Supreme Court doesn't like lower courts expanding the narrow Bivens confines, so this has a good chance of getting overturned if the top court picks it up. Until then, it's still a win for Boule and other US citizens. And maybe this win will remain on the books if the Supreme Court feels it's been cutting the government way too much slack in cases like these.
