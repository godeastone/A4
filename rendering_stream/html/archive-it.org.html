These webpages were created by the government of Salt Lake County to assist them in their mission of providing public safety, health services, and cultural and recreation opportunities while also managing property, growth, and development issues.  Salt Lake County is the most populous county in the state of Utah, and is the location of the state capital, Salt Lake City.

The pages selected and preserved contain information of long-term administrative or historical value.  These pages are for research purposes only; information may be outdated.  For the latest Salt Lake County government information please visit the live website at http://www.slco.org/.  
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
A brief history of the County: The Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake valley in 1847 to establish a religious settlement, and the “State of Deseret” government was created. The Legislative Assembly officially created Great Salt Lake County on January 31, 1850. Over 11,000 residents lived in the County at that time. The first formal meeting of Salt Lake County government occurred on March 15, 1852, eighteen months after the Utah Territory was established by the United States Congress. Probate judges and county selectmen functioned in what was known as the County Court. The duties of the County Court included both judicial and executive powers for the administration of county government.
 
With statehood in 1896, a county commission was created. At this time, County government had a County Auditor, Assessor, Attorney, Clerk, Recorder, Sheriff, Surveyor, and Treasurer – the same independent offices that exist today. In 2000, a new Mayor/Council form of government was chosen by the voters to replace the County Commission.  Today, County government serves over 1 million residents.

Renowned for its small, focused exhibitions and for its highly regarded concert series and lectures, The Frick Collection also operates the Frick Art Reference Library, founded by Henry Clay Frick’s daughter, Helen Clay Frick, located in an adjoining building at 10 East 71st Street. Both a research library and a photo archive, the Frick Art Reference Library is one of the world’s great repositories of documents for the study of Western art.

Understanding the upheavals that Syria has experienced since 2011 is an epistemological, ethical and reflective challenge, as the researcher’s involvement has become almost inevitable. The SHAKK (“uncertainty” in Arabic) project intends to take up these different challenges in a multidisciplinary and comparative perspective. Associating the Center for Social Sciences of Religion (CéSOR), the French Institute for the Near East (Ifpo), the Audiovisual Department of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF) and  the Institute of Research and Study on the Arab and Muslim Worlds (Iremam) the team is composed of nine researchers – anthropologists, political scientists, historians and linguists – in addition to a research engineer, an Arabist, a digital humanities specialist, and finally an archivist specialized in audiovisual technology.

The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art arose from the instincts and ambitions of two private individuals who shared the dream of providing a public art museum for Kansas City and the surrounding region.
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
William Rockhill Nelson, founder of The Kansas City Star, was convinced that for a city to be truly civilized, art and culture were necessities. When he died in 1915, the bulk of his estate was used to establish the William Rockhill Nelson Trust for the purchase of works of art “which will contribute to the delectation and enjoyment of the public generally.” The Nelson estate was combined with Mary Atkins’ legacy to build an art museum for the people of Kansas City. The William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art and the Mary Atkins Museum of Fine Arts opened to the public on Dec. 11, 1933.  Today, the Nelson-Atkins maintains collections of more than 35,000 works of art and welcomes 500,000 visitors a year.

<p class="seamTextPara">
We welcome and provide free admission to all, and deliver unparalleled opportunities to enjoy, appreciate and understand the finest visual arts and the varied cultures they represent—on our campus, online, and throughout Kansas City.

As the preeminent institution devoted to the art of the United States, the Whitney Museum of American Art presents the full range of twentieth-century and contemporary American art, with a special focus on works by living artists. The Whitney is dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting, and exhibiting American art, and its collection--arguably the finest holding of twentieth-century American art in the world--is the Museum's key resource. The Museum's signature exhibition, the Biennial, is the country's leading survey of the most recent developments in American art.
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
Innovation has been a hallmark of the Whitney since its beginnings. It was the first museum dedicated to the work of living American artists and the first New York museum to present a major exhibition of a video artist (Nam June Paik in 1982). Such figures as Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, and Cindy Sherman were given their first museum retrospectives by the Whitney. The Museum has consistently purchased works within the year they were created, often well before the artists became broadly recognized. The Whitney was the first museum to take its exhibitions and programming beyond its walls by establishing corporate-funded branch facilities, and the first museum to undertake a program of collection-sharing (with the San Jose Museum of Art) in order to increase access to its renowned collection.
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
Designed by architect Renzo Piano and situated between the High Line and the Hudson River, the Whitney's new building vastly increases the Museum’s exhibition and programming space, providing the first comprehensive view of its unsurpassed collection of modern and contemporary American art.</p>

In order to facilitate a diversity of direct dispatches from around our city, we lent recording equipment – and offered training in its use – to community organizations, neighborhood groups and individuals. While the project is no longer accepting contributions, previously contributed recordings can still be shared, reused and adapted by others (please refer to our license for additional information). 
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
From our mission: “Our intent is to make more accessible the authentic, unedited sounds and voices of New Orleans. Sharing the sounds of our city as we hear them, move through them, and create them, is an act of celebration. But it also serves each contributor – you and me and anyone else who might participate – as a simple way to extend our own experience to others, harness our representations and those of our city, and participate in New Orleans' public culture with intentionality.”</p>

KRIA is a community effort to gather and preserve the content around the citizen-driven Icelandic constitutional reform process.
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
In 2011, Iceland rewrote its constitution using an historically open process. It reshaped the dialogue on how a population can use available technology, consensus building, and civic engagement when reinventing the governmental processes supporting the needs of their constituents. What resulted was a proposed constitution that was affirmed by a public referendum. While Parliament has yet to ratify the proposal, the effort is still alive and well, and is gaining traction and interest globally.
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
Yet there’s a threat that this historically relevant process will disappear without documentation.
Bits and pieces of this whole process have been kept in a variety of formats and locations. With proper documentation, this process can be a valuable resource for generations to come. Much of what went into making this proposed constitution a unique and relevant document can be preserved and made readily available to all. Because it was the first crowdsourced national constitution in history, there hasn’t been a blueprint on how it should be cataloged… until now.
</p>

<p class="seamTextPara">
This effort is a collaboration with the Icelandic National Archives, the University of Washington, the University of Iceland, the Icelandic Constitutional Society, Syracuse University, peacebuilding organization <q>Build Up</q> and the University College Cork.</p>
