Touch latency depends on many factors like the timing of a game’s display vsync and its frame submission. Due to heavy game workloads, a game may miss the vsync deadline, resulting in a delayed frame. This delayed frame then impacts the latency of the touch event. Qualcomm Game Quick Touch is optimized at the millisecond level to avoid these delays, which will allow a gamer to immediately experience faster response times. \u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n"},{"type":"image","image":"https://www.qualcomm.com/sites/ember/files/styles/optimize/public/blog/managed-images/game-quick-touch_sized.jpg?itok=W-dD0a8L","class":"inline","description":"","title":"","alt":"","width":688,"height":330},{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;Our lab testing shows that Qualcomm Game Quick Touch can decrease the touch latency by up to 20 percent.

In a typical example in AAA games today, there are 3.6 million pixels being shaded on the display. VRS allows developers to specify that the shader program only run once in groups of two or four pixels. It then reuses those color results for the surrounding pixels. VRS means that a developer can shade the entire frame using only 1.4 million pixels. This results in 40 percent more efficiency, while greatly diminishing the GPU workload providing for greater power savings.\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;While the GPU workload is reduced via VRS, the graphical fidelity remains constant. Games will see a 30 percent increase in gameplay performance from previous Snapdragon chipsets while running smoother and longer with lower power. The end result is that developers will have more headroom to take advantage of the hardware and can create larger and more unique experiences in the next generation of mobile games. \u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;Our missions for Snapdragon Elite Gaming is to transform mobile devices into powerful gaming machines.

Touch latency depends on many factors like the timing of a game’s display vsync and its frame submission. Due to heavy game workloads, a game may miss the vsync deadline, resulting in a delayed frame. This delayed frame then impacts the latency of the touch event. Qualcomm Game Quick Touch is optimized at the millisecond level to avoid these delays, which will allow a gamer to immediately experience faster response times. \u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n"},{"type":"image","image":"https://www.qualcomm.com/sites/ember/files/styles/optimize/public/blog/managed-images/game-quick-touch_sized.jpg?itok=W-dD0a8L","class":"inline","description":"","title":"","alt":"","width":688,"height":330},{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;Our lab testing shows that Qualcomm Game Quick Touch can decrease the touch latency by up to 20 percent.

In a typical example in AAA games today, there are 3.6 million pixels being shaded on the display. VRS allows developers to specify that the shader program only run once in groups of two or four pixels. It then reuses those color results for the surrounding pixels. VRS means that a developer can shade the entire frame using only 1.4 million pixels. This results in 40 percent more efficiency, while greatly diminishing the GPU workload providing for greater power savings.\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;While the GPU workload is reduced via VRS, the graphical fidelity remains constant. Games will see a 30 percent increase in gameplay performance from previous Snapdragon chipsets while running smoother and longer with lower power. The end result is that developers will have more headroom to take advantage of the hardware and can create larger and more unique experiences in the next generation of mobile games. \u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;Our missions for Snapdragon Elite Gaming is to transform mobile devices into powerful gaming machines.

This enabled developers to write custom operators in OpenCL or use the Qualcomm Hexagon SDK and then plug them into the Qualcomm Neural Processing SDK. However, even for developers that are already experienced with Hexagon, to create operators, you often needed to write complex and long routines in low-level languages.\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;As part of our commitment to enable access to the 6th gen Qualcomm AI Engine, this year, we announced that we’ve extended TVM, an open-source compiler for AI accelerators, with support for Hexagon. Now, custom operators can be written in a few short lines of Python, compiled for Hexagon, and plugged directly into the Qualcomm AI Engine direct framework.\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;Lastly, we added additional support to the \u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003ca href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/05/04/open-sourcing-ai-model-efficiency-toolkit\"&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;AI Model Efficiency Toolkit\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/span&gt;\u003c/a&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt;\u003cspan&gt; (AIMET) for even better quantization of networks, with little or no loss in accuracy, using post-training techniques such as Adaround, and quantization aware training with range learning.

While we can’t get together in Hawaii this time, we’ve been hard at work on technologies that push boundaries, and we’re excited to share them with you virtually over the next two days. In fact, we’re feeling more grateful than ever for the work we do, because without the connectivity breakthroughs we’ve made over the years, this type of virtual event wouldn’t even be possible.\u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;Taking the (virtual) stage first is Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon with an update on the global \u003ca href=\"/products/5g\"&gt;5G\u003c/a&gt; rollout — including the international expansion of 5G mmWave. He’ll also talk about the role our Snapdragon 8 series has had on the evolution of the smartphone and premium mobile experiences such as \u003ca href=\"/invention/artificial-intelligence?gclid=CjwKCAiA7939BRBMEiwA-hX5JwttMzCzdn04D0N2cMh2MeDfX57yaFnOph-R3DaS8RpyjMSvESG1jRoCHqMQAvD_BwE\"&gt;AI\u003c/a&gt;, \u003ca href=\"/products/smartphones/gaming\"&gt;gaming\u003c/a&gt;, and \u003ca href=\"/products/cameras\"&gt;camera\u003c/a&gt;. What’s more, he’ll be joined by some of our ecosystem collaborators, including Docomo and Verizon, as well as guests from Chinese National Geography, Sony Mobile Communications, and more. \u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;5G commercialization had a fast start last year, and the momentum continues to grow. And beyond connectivity, it’s clear that premium features — from mobile cloud gaming to intelligent camera experiences — aren’t a nice-to-have; they’re a requirement. We’re listening to what consumers want and need, while also pushing beyond their imagination to create new possibilities. This starts with smartphones, but Snapdragon is also defining premium for the next wave of digital transformation that will enable industries across sectors. \u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;One such industry is \u003ca href=\"/products/mobile-computing\"&gt;mobile computing\u003c/a&gt;. Alex Katouzian, senior vice president and general manager of mobile, compute and infrastructure at Qualcomm Technologies, will dive into this revolution, which brings the best of the smartphone, including 5G, to your mobile PC. As we work, learn, socialize, and even attend tech conferences from home, this connectivity is playing an even more important role in our lives. He’ll also discuss growth and expansion in \u003ca href=\"/invention/extended-reality\"&gt;XR\u003c/a&gt;, cloud AI, and 5G \u003ca href=\"/news/onq/2020/09/17/fwa-breakthroughs-show-promise-5g-mmwave-extended-ranges\"&gt;Fixed Wireless Access (FWA)\u003c/a&gt;, as well as make the biggest announcement of this year’s Snapdragon Tech Summit — our most advanced platform ever, the Snapdragon 888 Mobile Platform. \u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;This comprehensive mobile solution will power a sensational lineup of flagship Android smartphones and usher in a new era in mobile. Lekha Motiwala, director of product management at Qualcomm Technologies, will further break down what’s included in this revolutionary platform, including our biggest leap forward in AI ever, with our 6th Generation Qualcomm AI Engine, as well as our 3rd Generation of Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite Gaming and camera features that will change the way people use their smartphone cameras. \u003c/p&gt;\n"},{"type":"image","image":"https://www.qualcomm.com/sites/ember/files/styles/optimize/public/blog/managed-images/twodrivers_inline_600x444.png?itok=cpaxUYwh","class":"inline","description":"","title":"","alt":"","width":688,"height":444},{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp&gt;But it’s not enough just to talk about this breakthrough. We’re going to show you in a fun way, too. \u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;We built a racetrack on the Qualcomm campus, and we have two radio-controlled cars ready to compete head-to-head. Forget the cars you played with as a kid — these are connected and controlled over 5G mmWave and our new Snapdragon 888 mobile platform, respectively. mmWave allows for the world’s fastest multi-Gigabit 5G speeds, and because of the capabilities of this new platform, the drivers can control and race the cars without being anywhere near the track. In fact, they’ll be an entire mile away. \u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;The point-of-view from the cars will be streamed to the drivers over 5G, working together with GPS, and our premium camera technologies to allow the drivers to see where their cars are headed. Additionally, new GNSS and sensor technologies will enable lane-level navigation with meter-level accuracy. This all comes together with the help of some great partners, including Verizon, Ericsson, and Tension, who provided the spectrum, 5G infrastructure equipment, and real-time applications for the drivers, respectively. \u003c/p&gt;\n\u003cp&gt;We’re so excited to kick off this year’s Snapdragon Tech Summit. Hundreds of teams around the globe worked tirelessly to bring this new mobile platform to life, and we have so many other announcements, demos, and partner perspectives in store.
