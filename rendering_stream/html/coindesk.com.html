That allows you to have the flexibility to focus on managing risks of what’s new in this space.”\n\nPitcher hopes to create a system that allows Bermudians to spend the digital currency they receive on government services and, in so doing, build a bridge to overseas economies…\n\n“By allowing the government to accept it, it provides an opportunity for merchants to start saying, ‘Well, I can look at accepting digital dollars,’” he said. “So taxi operators, tourism operators, commercial businesses have a place to actually spend, which means that you’re not going to have to fall back to the traditional financial system.”\n\nPitcher hopes these systems will finally introduce ordinary Bahamians into the global financial ecosystem.\n\n“Our history allows us to really understand financial services,” he said. “But the challenge that comes from this is that when it comes to access to financial services, Bermudians are largely excluded. We don’t have access to PayPal, Revolut, or Square and in order to actually get access to the Apple App Store we buy credit or gift cards.”\n\n“We’re too small,” he said. “Nobody cares about 60,000 people.”\n\nWith a digital currency plan, however, Pitcher believes the Bahamas will become more than just a financial product supplier and will, eventually, turn into a financial powerhouse of its own.","feedId":"q2p9RLBX","mediaId":"n18HxYD4","date":1580510877,"duration":"07m 38s","videoSrc":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/n18HxYD4-g7qpiU9Y.mp4","url":"","slug":"bermuda-is-planning-a-comprehensive-crypto-ecosystem"},{"id":"f36dee94-bdee-4b75-acb0-826ab01d3368","poster":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/0NKaRx9q/poster.jpg?width=720","title":"Why Is a Cypherpunk in Davos?","text":"Nym Technologies CEO Harry Halpin speaks to CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen in Davos, Switzerland about the World Economic Forum, privacy and the future of blockchain.","feedId":"q2p9RLBX","mediaId":"0NKaRx9q","date":1579741922,"duration":"05m 57s","videoSrc":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0NKaRx9q-g7qpiU9Y.mp4","url":"","slug":"why-is-a-cypherpunk-in-davos"},{"id":"da04a978-bfba-4b74-bc81-6cff97dc5e39","poster":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/kuTXpKIS/poster.jpg?width=720","title":"Digital Humans at CES","text":"Danny Tomsett of UneeQ talks to us about his Digital Humans at CES 2020.","feedId":"q2p9RLBX","mediaId":"kuTXpKIS","date":1580319255,"duration":"05m 07s","videoSrc":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kuTXpKIS-g7qpiU9Y.mp4","url":"","slug":"digital-humans-at-ces"},{"id":"591afe6a-cd79-43b7-8dd9-73c70f1eac77","poster":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/x6SGMb9h/poster.jpg?width=720","title":"‘Fluffypony’ Weighs In on CBDC Trend at Davos 2020","text":"Ricardo Spagni, better known as “Fluffypony” discusses privacy and whether or not central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are just a fleeting trend.
