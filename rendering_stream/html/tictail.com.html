            <h1>Thank you!</h1>
            <p>For the past 7 years, we’ve been proud to enable emerging brands around the world build global businesses. From weekend hackathons, to launching Carl’s moms business as our first store, to the first 10,000 customers to this – a global creative community that never ceases to surprise, inspire and drive us forward.</p>
            <p>We are looking forward to the amazing things we will now be able to accomplish as a part of Shopify - we’re really just getting started. This was the ethos when we first introduced Tictail to the world 7 years ago, and now, as we’re taking our biggest step forward yet, it rings truer than ever.</p>
            <p>We want to thank everyone involved in the journey so far; our team, our brands, our customers and our investors - and welcome you on to this next chapter, we can’t wait to continue our journey with you. See you at Shopify!</p>
            <p>/ Birk, Carl, Kaj &amp; Siavash<br />Co-founders</p>
