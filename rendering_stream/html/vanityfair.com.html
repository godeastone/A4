class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly four years after &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; moved into the White House, there are a number of things weâve come to expect from the administration, whose incompetence, chaos, and self-dealing is actually quite predictable. We can expect that the president will spend a significant portion of his day tweeting incomprehensible attacks on people deemed disloyal. We can expect that &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Miller&lt;/strong&gt; will actively &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/stephen-miller-separated-children-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hatch&lt;/a&gt; unique ways to make immigrantsâ lives hell. And we can expect that, given the opportunity, Trump and his children will do everything they can to profit off the presidency, no matter how transparently shady and corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, really, it was only a matter of time before we learned that businesses owned by Trump and by his son-in-lawâs family received millions of dollars in pandemic relief loans. Or that, despite the fact that the money was in large part meant to keep employees from being laid off, only a handful of employees at Trump and Kushner&amp;#8211;owned companies were kept on the payroll. Per &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/release-ppp-loan-recipients-data-reveals-troubling-patterns-n1249629\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SweepingÂ [analysis of] data released by the Small Business Administrationâ¦found that properties owned by the Trump Organization as well as the Kushner Companies, owned by the family of &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt;, President Donald Trumpâs son-in-law and senior adviser, profited from the program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over 25 PPP loans worth more than $3.65 million were given to businesses with addresses at Trump and Kushner real estate properties, paying rent to those owners. Fifteen of the properties self-reported that they only kept one job, zero jobs, or did not report a number at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump, of course, chose not to divest from his company upon becoming president, and continues to profit from it&amp;#8212;profits that have gotten a nice boost thanks to his insistence on &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/key-charges-trump-properties/2020/10/27/bfa39b08-16cd-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; foreign leaders at his properties, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/trump-organization-secret-service-bills\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;gouging the Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;, and charging taxpayers &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-water\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;for water he drinks at Mar-a-Lago&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. Kushner, along with &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-financial-disclosure.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; at least $36 million last year, largely through his stake in his familyâs real estate firm. (In 2017, the duo &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-financial-disclosure.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; income of at least $82 million, so times are obviously tough.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to revealing the loans to the Trump and Kushner businesses, the PPP data showed ridiculous mismanagement of the program, with over 100 loans going to companies with no name listed and other companies appearing to game the system for loans as high as $10 million through their subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The PPP programsâ original stated intent by officials was to help with payroll for small businesses struggling under the effects of coronavirus lockdown measuresâ¦. But almost from the start, the programs, particularly PPP, drew criticism for how they were administered and messaged, and whether it was equitable. Large national banks initially gave loans only to customers with whom they had pre-existing lending relationships. Businesses owned by people of color without strong banking relationshipsÂ found themselves with limited accessÂ and forced them to find other routes for funding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There was also the persistent question of what defined a âsmall business,â after lobbying by the hotel and restaurant industry ballooned the maximum number of employees allowable to 500, even though over 98 percent of the small businesses in America have fewer than 100 employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âMany months and broken promises later, the court-ordered release of this crucial data while the Trump administration is one foot out the door is a shameful dereliction of duty and flagrant mismanagement of a program that millions of workers and small businesses needed to get through this pandemic,â &lt;strong&gt;Kyle Herrig&lt;/strong&gt;, president of Accountable.US, an accountability watchdog, said in a statement. But Trump and Kushner got their money so, six of one, half a dozen of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, clickÂ &lt;a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;Â to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

How ridiculous to ask me that question and waste our time.â While he presumably thought that would be the end of that, Porter was only getting started. âWell, Secretary Mnuchin,â she said, âI think itâs ridiculous that youâre play-acting to be a lawyer when you have no legal degree.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responding as only someone whoâs probably uttered the words âmy maid makes more in a year than you will your entire life,â Mnuchin shot back, âWell, actually, I have plenty of lawyers at the Department of Treasury who advise me,â adding that they would âexplain all the legal provisions.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âSecretary Mnuchin, are you in fact a lawyer?â Porter continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âI do not have a legal degree, I have lawyers [who] report to me,â Mnuchin answered, with characteristic condescension.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Porter then turned to Fed chair &lt;strong&gt;Jerome Powell&lt;/strong&gt; and, confirming he does have a law degree, told Mnuchin, âOkay, so Secretary Mnuchin, you are trying to tell Chairman Powell to send over any remaining funds right now, and youâre claiming falsely, in my opinion, that that is what the law says.â Mnuchin responded by asking Porter, who &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidgura/status/1334172687942492170\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum laude&lt;/a&gt;

on the eighth floor of the State Department involving hundreds of guests, food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pompeoâs lineup of parties in the next three weeks comes as the Trump administrationâs own health experts are imploring Americans to limit travel and avoid large gatherings amid aÂ pandemicÂ that hasÂ killed more than 270,000 AmericansÂ and infected nearly 14Â million across the United Statesâ¦. President Trump is alsoÂ hosting holiday partiesÂ at the White House that defy his own health expertsâ public guidance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked about the super-spreader event waiting to happen, a State Department spokesperson &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/pompeo-coronavirus-holiday-parties/2020/12/02/9a06d0a6-3421-11eb-afe6-e4dbee9689f8_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; âWe plan to fully enforce social distancing measures at this reception, and face coverings are mandatory for admittance.â Asked how attendees could keep their mask on at a party that includes food and drink, or socially distance when there are 900 invited guests, the spokesman did not have answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A day after Justice Dept. found no evidence of widespread election fraud, Trump posts 45-minute video filled with falsehoods.

Carter&lt;/strong&gt; had his peanut farm. The Bush family had its oil interests. But there was really &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/09/trumps-conflicts-of-interest-are-without-precedent-in-american-presidential-history/\"&gt;no precedent&lt;/a&gt; for the shady and complex web of business interests &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; brought into the White House with him four years ago. Not only did he never untangle himself from his personal interests; over the course of four tumultuous years, he actively blurred the line between the personal, professional, and political until there was no distinguishing between the three. If his presidency was unprecedented, so, too, will his post-presidency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump never really left his financial interests behind. But when he leaves office next month, heâll once again be the face of his family business&amp;#8212;and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/01/trump-foreign-real-estate-441928\"&gt;according to Politico&lt;/a&gt;, thatâll mean a quick return to making foreign real estate deals, raising novel ethical concerns. âThe president does not feel bound by actual legal prohibitions, much less merely ethical or moral ones,â Congressman &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Raskin&lt;/strong&gt;, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told the outlet. âWe can expect that he will continue to operate his business in conjunction with foreign businesses and governments.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Buried in debt, and with a brand inextricably linked in the United States to his toxic politics, Trump is expected to consider or pursue real estate ventures in India, China, Turkey, and other countries after leaving office, sources familiar with his thinking told Politico. âHeâll do what he does,â former Trump executive &lt;strong&gt;Barbara Res&lt;/strong&gt; said. That tracks with what his sons, who have nominally been in charge of the family business while their dad was in office, have publicly said on the matter. âAfter politics,â &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/india-to-be-a-big-focus-post-politics-says-trump-jr-1568399340863.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; an Indian newspaper last year, âwe would certainly look at India and other markets.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the post-presidency tends to be a cushy gig for those who occupied the Oval Office&amp;#8212;replete with paid speeches and big dollar book deals&amp;#8212;Trump will do what no other president has done before, inviting criticism that his projects could be used to âpay back Trump for his policies as president or to influence U.S. policy through a former president,â as Politico put it. And, of course, that all becomes more complicated if Trump runs again in 2024, as he has &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/if-trump-runs-in-2024-he-may-launch-his-campaign-on-bidens-inauguration-day\"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; at.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âThere are some boundaries that didnât exist before,â Democratic Congressman &lt;strong&gt;Gerry Connolly&lt;/strong&gt; of the House Oversight Committee told the outlet. âAnd I have no doubt that he will blow past those boundaries and not respect any of them.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/trump-has-done-a-great-job-profiting-off-the-presidency\"&gt;success&lt;/a&gt; Trump apparently had profiting off the presidency the past four years, itâs not particularly surprising that he would continue to wield it to his benefit as he leaves office and after. Already heâs been using his dead-end battle to overturn the election results to &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/trump-supporters-donate-millions-legal-challenges-election\"&gt;wring money&lt;/a&gt; out of his supporters. But he likely hopes that what that scheme ultimately yields will look like small change compared with his post-presidency ventures. âWhat Trump is doing is trying to make a vast fortune, which has never been tried before, parlaying his presidency into massive amounts of money abroad,â presidential historian &lt;strong&gt;Douglas Brinkley&lt;/strong&gt; told Politico. âIâve never seen anything like it.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

the tradition of choosing godparents is widespread, &lt;strong&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/strong&gt;âs role at the head of the Church of England makes the tradition especially important in the royal family. Recently the family has also found ways to emphasize their personal relationships and passions, choosing honored friends or particularly important mentors. One of the earliest examples of that came when &lt;strong&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/strong&gt; and Princess Diana chose &lt;strong&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/strong&gt;âs six godparents and included Dianaâs former roommate &lt;strong&gt;Carolyn Bartholomew&lt;/strong&gt; and Lady Celia Vestey, a member of the queenâs inner circle. On November 28, Celia passed away âsuddenly, but peacefullyâ at the age of 71, according to her familyâs notice in the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph.&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports that &lt;a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13344927/prince-harry-godmother-dies-lady-celia-vestey/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Harry has contacted her children&lt;/a&gt; to share his condolences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She was the wife of &lt;strong&gt;Sam, Lord Vestey,&lt;/strong&gt; one of Englandâs richest businessmen, but her connection to the royals came through her love for horses, and from 1999 to 2018, Sam served as the Master of Horses for the royal household. In 1985, after Harry was born, &lt;strong&gt;Tina Brown&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/1985/10/the-mouse-that-roared\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Celia was one of the few people who was friends with both Charles and Diana. Ultimately it was an apt choice; Celia was known for her good-spirited humor, and she led a life that straddled the paths that each one of Harryâs parents wanted to take. Celiaâs sons attended Harryâs prep school, andÂ according to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-9004941/Prince-Harrys-godmother-Lady-Vestey-died-aged-71.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the two stayed in touch throughout his life. She was a guest at his 2018 wedding to &lt;strong&gt;Meghan Markle&lt;/strong&gt; and also made an appearance at &lt;strong&gt;Prince William&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kate Middleton&lt;/strong&gt;âs 2011 nuptials.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Celiaâs parents, Major Guy Knight and his wife Hester, were both born to prominent families, and her father won a military cross for his bravery during World War II. Celia was born in 1949, and in the early 1950s, the family began to manage the farmland at Lockinge Manor. Celiaâs sister, &lt;strong&gt;Henrietta Knight,&lt;/strong&gt; writes &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Not_Enough_Time/tQyiCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;in her memoir&lt;/a&gt; that their love for horses began early on. They both had their own ponies at a young age, and their mother began to breed Shetlands while they were still teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Celia first entered the royal fold because the Queen Mother was &lt;a href=\"https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/6603828.queen-mother-mourns/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;close friends&lt;/a&gt; with her parents and would come to dine at Lockinge every summer. When Henrietta became a professional trainer, she struck up a correspondence with the Queen Mother and was occasionally invited to spend weekends at Royal Lodge, her Windsor home, to attend lavish dinner parties. Celia never spoke publicly about her relationship to the Queen Mother, but in 1975, she was a part of the familyâs procession at Royal Ascot. Though they wouldnât meet until later, Sam was also a part of the royal pack that came together over their love for riding, hunting, and playing polo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Celia trained as a nurse at Westminster Hospital and enjoyed living in London, but horse breeding was still her passion. In a 1981 BBC documentary, she was filmed with the horse she would let occasionally let roam inside her house. âI wouldnât let just any horse inside,â she said, according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. âHe usually comes in once a week while we are having coffee.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She was still a nurse when &lt;strong&gt;Robert Fellowes,&lt;/strong&gt; a brother-in-law of Diana, introduced her to Sam. After Samâs first marriage ended in divorce, his best friend Fellowes invited Celia to a dinner party, which was a success. In 1996, she told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; that their first romantic moment took place at a dance held to celebrate Charles and Dianaâs wedding in 1981. âThe Queen gave a dance before Prince Charles married Lady Di and I met Sam on the stairs going up to say âhow do you doâ to the Queen. A regimental band was playing,â she said. âI was wearing some old, clapped-out long dress, nothing glamorous, but he danced with me all night.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Celia went to visit Sam at his house, Stowell Park, for the first time, she brought her favorite horse (also named Sam) along because she didnât want to be separated from the horse for too long. âOn Sunday we were in the car coming back from church and he asked me to marry him,â she said. âWe actually courted, got engaged, and married in four months.â Though they would later attend some of the royal familyâs most spectacular weddings, they opted for something much smaller themselves. Celia wore a somber black velvet gown to a simple ceremony at the Wantage Register Office, near her parentsâ house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the wedding, they decided to combine their horse-breeding operations at Stowell, and Sam eventually became the head of the Cheltenham racecourse, which hosts an annual horse festival beloved by the royals. They saw success with their breeding operation, and Celia even sent a horse to compete for Britain at the Olympics. One year, a horse bred by Celia, owned by Sam, and trained by Henrietta won a competitive race with the Queen Mother watching along. âIt was a truly family affair and a magic moment,â Sam told the &lt;em&gt;Gloucestershire Echo&lt;/em&gt; in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The couple went on to have three children. In November 1995, Celia suffered a life-threatening hemorrhagic stroke that left her with weakness on her left side and temporarily slurred speech. The next spring, she praised Sam for his support. âA friend of ours said Sam never ever let it enter his mind that he might lose me, though he knew I was incredibly ill and living on a knife edge,â she said. âIt has made me realize how much he loves me and I became fantastically possessive. I was terrified to let him out of my sight. I couldnât understand why I was like that because Iâm not a possessive person.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They eventually became close to the queen and last year, Sam became one of her permanent Lords-in-Waiting. Over the last few years, they were occasional weekend guests at Windsor and in 2016, a source told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; that the queen was âfondâ of Celiaâs âlively company.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In her first interview after her stroke, she lamented above all that she wouldnât be able to attend the annual festival at Cheltenham, but replied with wisdom fit for the royal family. âThe thing I have learned is that you really cannot ever predict what is going to happen,â she said. âYou never know what is round the corner of your life.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity

the unseasonably warm afternoon of Saturday, November 7, &lt;strong&gt;Mary L. Trump&lt;/strong&gt; was in her beachfront condo overlooking Cape Cod Bay when the news flashed across her TV screen. Four days after the polls had closed, the Associated Press finally called the election for &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; heralding an end to the preternaturally bonkers presidency of Maryâs uncle and bÃªte noire, &lt;strong&gt;Donald J. Trump.&lt;/strong&gt; Mary picked up her phone and texted her daughter, who rang mom right away so they could share what was, for them and at least 80.9 million other Americans, a moment of immense happiness. Then Mary grabbed a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and hit the beach, where she drained her Champagne glass while basking in the near-75-degree mid-autumn sunshine. âI just felt this energy that I havenât felt in a while,â she told me this week. âThe sense of relief I felt was just so incredible.âÂ &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the factors that contributed to Trumpâs close but decisive defeat&amp;#8212;his administrationâs feckless approach to the pandemic; the desire of certain swing state voters to see a sense of normalcy restored to the White House&amp;#8212;Mary might have played at least a small role. Over the summer her best-selling book for Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, &lt;em&gt;Too Much and Never Enough,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/a-conclusive-diagnosis-of-donald-trumps-psychopathology\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;gave readers a damning portrait&lt;/a&gt; of Trumpâs troubled upbringing and complex psychopathology. It was a compelling narrative buoyed by her Ph.D. in clinical psychology and rooted in her lifelong experience as a member of the âdysfunctionalâ (Maryâs word) Trump family&amp;#8212;a ringside perspective to which even the best journalistic tell-all could not lay claim. To date, more than 1.2 million copies have been sold, according to NPD BookScan, and as of this week, &lt;em&gt;Too Much and Never Enough&lt;/em&gt; was number one on &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/2020/books/ref=zg_bs_tab_t_bsar\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Amazonâs list of 2020 best sellers&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt;âs just-released memoir nipping at its heels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now Mary plans to apply her clinical training to another literary pursuit, one that will continue grappling with her uncleâs dramatic and, very likely, long-lasting impact on American politics and society. Announced Tuesday by Macmillanâs St. Martinâs Press, and scheduled to hit shelves on July 20, &lt;em&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/em&gt; âwill examine,â &lt;a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/the-reckoning/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;according to the promotional copy&lt;/a&gt;, âAmericaâs national trauma, rooted in our history but dramatically exacerbated by the impact of current events and the Trump administrationâs corrupt and immoral policies.... Whether it manifests itself in rising levels of rage and hatred, or hopelessness and apathy, the stress of living in a country we no longer recognize has affected all of us. America is suffering from PTSD.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mary called me Tuesday afternoon to talk about it&amp;#8212;and lots of other things too. Like, for instance, what she predicts for Trump and his children after the curtain falls on the 45th presidency. Hereâs a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You could have just faded back out of the spotlight after the election. Aside from the financial incentive, what made you want to do another book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Trump:&lt;/em&gt; The fact of the matter is, the work isnât done. Thereâs never any way to know how a book is going to be received, so the first one was certainly risky. There was a lot of downside, and no way to know if there was going to be an upside. But it seems to have broken through and landed in aÂ way I didnât anticipate it would, and so thatâs been really gratifying. And now I have a platform. We are going to continue to be in so much trouble, and if I can continue to be of use and be helpful, thatâs what I should do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess the book is going to answer this, but how&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;we recover from our collective PTSD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Itâs so complicated because first of all, the trauma is the history of this country in some ways, so we kind of need to go back so we can understand why we were so vulnerable, why we continue in large measure to make the wrong decisions, and why we fail to do the things that could protect us from these situations, why we seem never to learn the lessons that we should have learned. There is this overarching historical perspective that needs to be examined. Weâre going to have to hit the ground running as hard as possible. Luckily, with the incoming administration, we will have an opportunity to do that now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talk about âthe stress of living in a country we no longer recognize.â Do you think weâll start to recognize it more under a Biden presidency, or have we crossed the point of no return?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It depends on who youâre talking about. There are people among us who have always existed&amp;#8212;unrepentant racists, white supremacists, people who are hateful and nothing you say is gonna change their mind, nothing the government does to make their lives better is gonna convince them the government isnât out to get them. The problem is, under this current administration, theyâve been activated and represented in a way they never have been before. Then thereâs the other people among the 73 million who voted for Donald, which, letâs be clear, thatâs a horrific number, but a lot of those people after the inauguration will say, âOkay, Bidenâs my president. You win some, you lose some,â and hopefully their lives will get better and theyâll see that the last four years were something we can avoid in the future if we put up certain safeguards. Living with these levels of stress, itâs incredibly unhealthy in all sorts of ways, and it isnât just COVID. It isnât just economic uncertainty and fear. We basically now live in fear of our fellow human beings, and on top of all that is this sense of betrayal. For some of us itâs the sense that we believed that our government was there to protect us and help us in tough times, and clearly that hasnât happened. In fact, the opposite is the case&amp;#8212;the government has actually made things worse.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For some of these people whose beliefs are so entrenched, youâre probably one of the last people theyâd be willing to listen to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have been very honest about my own politics, but I didnât feel like my last book was political. It was more about giving people information I didnât think they had four years ago. Similarly, I see this book as a way to force, or at least to encourage, this vitally important conversation about the countryâs mental health, or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youâve maintained a media profile since publishing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Too-Much-Never-Enough-Dangerous/dp/1982141468\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too Much and Never Enough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;***.*** &lt;strong&gt;What has your life been like behind the scenes? You put a target on your back by going public in the way that you did.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the book first came out, I took all the necessary precautions, and then something really weird happened, and itâs a sign of the times that I find this shocking: I didnât receive any threats of any kind, and I had people actively looking for me. Itâs quite remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout inset-right\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youâre still in litigation with the family. Where does that stand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I filed suit a couple of months ago alleging fraud over a partnership I was involved in, where they, as part of the settlement of my grandfatherâs estate, bought me out of my share, and thatâs what I filed suit about. Once we get over this one certain hurdle involving a statute of limitations, I think it will go pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatâs your relationship with the family like at this point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I donât have one. But then again, I didnât before I published the book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you still speak with your aunt, Maryanne Trump Barry, whose private conversations with you were essential to key parts of the book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For reasons, and I have no idea why, but in, Iâd say, June of 2018, she just kind of stopped talking to me.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think some people, given the negative things she had to say about her brother, and the fact that your recordings of those conversations became public, some people wondered whether sheâd quietly given you her blessing. Sounds like thatâs not the case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I donât think thatâs the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you think Trump was going to lose the election?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did. I also felt very strongly that a landslide victory was necessary, and we didnât get that. Thank goodness Joe Biden won as decisively as he did, but we really needed a repudiation of not just Donald, but the entire party that enabled him. Seventy-three million votes is insane. I donât understand how he got more than 20 million, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you think Trumpâs reaction to losing would be this extreme, that he and his people would be going to these extreme lengths to defy the reality of the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, Iâm not surprised by any of it. Iâm a little bit surprised, and I know I should have learned my lesson by now, but I am a little bit surprised that the Republican leadership has been so craven in its willingness to endanger our democracy and the sanctity of our voting system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think this is going to end? Will he grudgingly retreat to Mar-a-Lago, or will federal marshals have to drag him out of the White House?&lt;/strong&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, heâs already checked out. Two thousand people are dying every day, and heâs playing golf. I think heâs much more focused on what he can get in the next 50 days, what kinds of deals he can make. So far the likeliest scenario Iâve heard is that heâs gonna counterprogram the inauguration, maybe with a rally announcing his 2024 candidacy, which is a complete joke, or something like that.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout inset-left\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you predict from your uncle and his children over the next four years?&lt;/strong&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, as soon as Biden is inaugurated, Donald loses a huge amount of relevance, and therefore so do his children. I donât think they quite understand how badly damaged that brand is. Also, and this is what gives me some hope, Donald isnât just looking at lawsuits from me and &lt;strong&gt;E. Jean Carroll&lt;/strong&gt; and other people. Heâs also looking at serious exposure from banking institutions, which no longer have to protect him. And then of course thereâs the legal exposure. He is, and his children are, looking at potentially very serious charges&amp;#8212;tax fraud, money laundering, and what have you. I think the New York attorney general and Manhattan district attorney were very serious about pursuing these things all along, but I think Donald made the urgency of holding him accountable even greater just by his egregious behavior over the past several weeks. Theyâre gonna have their hands full.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything that frightens you about what they might still be capable of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Itâs not so much what they can do. Iâm more worried about what happens if heâs not held accountable, if theyâre not held accountable. I think that would be as damaging to this country as &lt;strong&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/strong&gt; staying majority leader in the long term, because then itâs just gonna happen again&amp;#8212;there will be a savvier politician paradingÂ as a populist who has the same autocratic tendencies, but heâs just better at it. And next time we wonât be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All products featured on&lt;/em&gt; Vanity Fair &lt;em&gt;are independently selected by our editors.

Well. Okay. Alright! Wow. Here we go: The Christmas season is on at the White House and weâre packing people in for parties! Okay!! Sure!!!Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a video shared on Facebook by &lt;strong&gt;Pam Pollard,&lt;/strong&gt; a former Oklahoma Republican Party chair, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9008283/Trump-teases-2024-run-White-House-Christmas-party.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daily Mail cut and published&lt;/a&gt;, a group that included Republican lawmakers gathered below a White House staircase this week as &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; descended from on high. One can hear a woman yell, âWe love you!â over and over as well as someone &lt;em&gt;coughing up a lung in the background&lt;/em&gt;. Itâs so dark and obvious it has to be a troll? Like someone canât actively have a heaving dry cough and go to an indoor Christmas party at the White House with 50 or so of your closest&amp;#8212;and I mean literally closest&amp;#8212;friends?Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melania Trump&lt;/strong&gt;âs spokesperson &lt;strong&gt;Stephanie Grisham&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/12/white-house-holiday-parties-covid-trump\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; this week that the organizers of the various holiday events at the White House would make some concessions to reality, like providing hand sanitizer and reducing guest lists. But that stuff doesnât matter much when you mash your body up against 20 other mostly mask-less Republicans in order to get a video of dear leader before he becomes a private citizen. Itâs like watching any show on television right now and seeing people justâ¦walkâ¦into a room andâ¦hugâ¦the other people in it without even a brief pause. Except these people should know better. They should know anything at all.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there was Trump above his simpering, sardine-like followers on the stairwell (to quote a colleague, for a man who professes to have seen and enjoyed &lt;a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-loves-evita-presidency/story?id=59350378\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evita&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; that guy really spends &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/donald-trump-looked-directly-at-the-eclipse\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a lot of time&lt;/a&gt; speaking down to his subjects on balconies). Trump used the opportunity to pledge that heâll always contest the results, though he does not say whether or not he and his crack team of lawyers will ever offer any legitimate evidence of fraud.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His exact words were, âWe are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, Iâll see you in four years.â Hm, weird to issue threats over the holidays, but this is the man who is forever the business dad from all those movies&amp;#8212;except heâs incapable of learning the true meaning of Christmas. The true meaning of Christmas is, remember, something something, love your son, something something, work less, something something, help save Santa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;

that everyone seems to have their own fashion, beauty, and skincare lines, celebrities have pivoted their attention to a whole new luxury market they can capitalize on&amp;#8212;candles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Right on the heels of &lt;strong&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s Tuesday &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CIOsO9wg8p9/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that he&amp;#39;s partnered with Byredo on an out-of-this-world fragrance and candle called &amp;quot;Space Rage,&amp;quot; his fellow rapper and âSicko Modeâ collaborator &lt;strong&gt;Drake&lt;/strong&gt; revealed today that he&amp;#39;s also getting into the fragrance business by teaming up with Revolve. While the debut of this new venture might seem a little sudden, the musician has actually been plotting his foray into the world of home fragrances for a minute, first teasing the brand on his Instagram Stories back in July. While he&amp;#39;s already gifted the candles to some of &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheWarriorsTalk/status/1283842784286277632\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;his famous friends&lt;/a&gt;, the candles are now available to the public just in time for the holidays, although already totally sold out. The high-end votives, sold under the label &lt;a href=\"https://betterworldfragrancehouse.co/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Better World Fragrance House&lt;/a&gt; and retailing for $80 apiece, come in five scents: &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-muskoka/dp/BWOR-WA3/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA3&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Muskoka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-good-thoughts/dp/BWOR-WA4/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA4&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Good Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-williamsburg-sleepover/dp/BWOR-WA1/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA1&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Williamsburg Sleepover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-sweeter-tings/dp/BWOR-WA2/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA2&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sweeter Tings&lt;/a&gt;, and Carby Musk, which &amp;quot;actually smells like Drake,â according to the product description.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, selling a candle based on your own scent is a classic &lt;strong&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/strong&gt; move. This summer, the actress turned wellness guru capitalized off the success of &lt;a href=\"https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/this-smells-like-my-vagina-candle?country=USA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;âThis Smells Like My Vagina,â&lt;/a&gt; her lifestyle brand Goop&amp;#39;s $75 candle that sold out in a matter of hours, by announcing &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/gwyneth-paltrow-orgasm-candle\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the release of her second scent&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;a href=\"https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/this-smells-like-my-orgasm-candle?taxon_id=1867&amp;amp;country=USA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;âThis Smells Like My Orgasm.â&lt;/a&gt; Since Paltrow first introduced her yoni-inspired business venture and everyone now spends the majority of their life indoors thanks to the pandemic, a number of other stars have jumped on the candle trend, including &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Hopkins, Alicia Keys, Kylie Jenner&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Kacey Musgraves&lt;/strong&gt;. But when it comes to self-scented and female anatomy-based fragrances, &lt;strong&gt;Erykah Badu&lt;/strong&gt; may have both Drake and the Goop progenitor beat with &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/02/erykah-badu-incense\"&gt;the launch of her own incense&lt;/a&gt; in February unambiguously dubbed âBadu&amp;#39;s

12 hours ago we wrote about the prospect of &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; âpreemptivelyâ pardoning his adult children, after &lt;strong&gt;Sean Hannity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/donald-trump-family-pardons\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt; him to âpardon his whole family and himself.â At the time it was merely a theoretical piece of advice from a Fox News anchor and not something the president was reported to actually be considering. But surprise: He is! And knowing him, heâll probably go through with it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In an updated story about &lt;strong&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/strong&gt; having discussed the prospect of a âpreemptiveâ pardon for himself, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-pardon.html?referringSource=articleShare\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Trump has talked to advisers about granting the same sort of all-inclusive pardon to &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Eric Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner.&lt;/strong&gt; (As has been the story of her life, there was sadly no mention of &lt;strong&gt;Tiffany Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; though in this case that may be an unintended compliment re: her not needing to worry about being prosecuted.) Trump has reportedly told people that he is concerned that âa Biden Justice Department might seek retribution against the president by targeting the oldest three of his five children,â as well as Ivankaâs husband. Of course previous outgoing administrations havenât had to worry about such things, and thatâs because they werenât known for being crime syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of legal exposure, Don Jr. was under investigation by &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller&lt;/strong&gt; during the Russia probe for contacts heâd had with Russians offering damning information about &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/strong&gt; during the 2016 campaign. While Muellerâs team considered charging Trump campaign officials in connection with the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, Don Jr. ultimately got off, not because he hadnât done some exceedingly sketchy stuff, but because Mueller &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/mueller-report-confirms-don-jr-too-stupid-to-collude-with-russia\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; he was too stupid to understand he was committing a crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With regard to the Boy Prince of New Jersey, Kushner provided federal authorities with false information about his contacts with foreigners when applying for his security clearance&amp;#8212;which can be charged as a federal crime&amp;#8212;though the president just decided to give him one anyway. When it comes to Eric, who is running the Trump Organization alongside his older brother in their fatherâs absence, he recently &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/05/politics/eric-trump-deposition-nyag/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;sat down&lt;/a&gt; for a deposition as part of the New York attorney generalâs investigation into whether the family business falsely inflated the value of its assets to secure loans and tax benefits. And on the Princess Purses front, the Manhattan District Attorneyâs Office has expanded its probe of the Trump Organization to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in âconsulting fees,â some of which seemingly went to Ivanka, who was very much an employee of the company and not a consultant. (The first daughter did not &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/ivanka-trump-donald-trump-tax-fraud\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;react well&lt;/a&gt; to this news last month.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Largely, though, it seems like Trump, the biggest grifter in presidential history, would like to pardon his children and son-in-law not just for any crimes they might have committed in the past, but any future ones too. As the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; notes, no president has ever attempted to pardon someone âfor crimes they have not yet committed&amp;#8212;essentially a prospective get-out-of-jail-free card,â and, unsurprisingly, legal experts believe such an action would be unlikely âto hold any weight.â But if anyone is going to try, itâs definitely this guy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in related, shocking news, given the stellar reputations of the people Donald J. Trump surrounds himself with, thereâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/politics/presidential-pardon-justice-department/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House or related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon,Â according to court records unsealed TuesdayÂ in federal court.... According to the court records, at the end of this summer, a filter team, used to make sure prosecutors donât receive tainted evidence that should have been kept from them because it was privileged, had more than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives, and computer drives after investigators raided the unidentified offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors told the court they wanted permission to the filter teamâs holdings. The prosecutors believed the devices revealed emails that showed allegedly criminal activity, including a âsecret lobbying schemeâ and a bribery conspiracy that offered âa substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentenceâ for a convicted defendant whose name is redacted, according to the redacted documents.... The White House declined to comment on the court filing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump has so far granted 29 pardons, including one last week for disgraced former national security adviser &lt;strong&gt;Mike Flynn,&lt;/strong&gt; for lying to the FBI, undisclosed lobbying work for Turkey, and âthe waterfront of potential related crimes that Flynn could have faced in the future.â As for his kids, ABC News &lt;a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-vetting-pardon-requests-push-trump-preemptively/story?id=74482289\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that âthe push for preemptive pardons began early this yearâ around the time of Trumpâs impeachment trial. At the time the discussions were, according to sources, âa series of hypotheticals,â though they have apparently since gained concrete urgency given Trumpâs loss to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

Department had not found sufficient evidence that would shift the results of the 2020 race. âTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,â Barr &lt;a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press, reiterating what judges and election officials across the aisle have said amid Trumpâs effort to undermine the results and reverse his loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the Trump campaign suffering repeated courtroom defeats, and the fact that GOP governors and secretaries of state have certified President-elect &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/strong&gt;âs win in key swing states, the admission from one of the presidentâs

of independence&amp;#8212;was especially notable, disputing not only Trumpâs post-election fantasy but also the right-wing media pushing his narrative. âFor weeks, these media personalities have strung their audiences along, suggesting that damning proof of fraud was just around the corner. Which is why the comment from Barr stung so bad,â &lt;a href=\"https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1606885940041f18317146c30/raw?utm_term=1606885940041f18317146c30&amp;amp;utm_source=Reliable+Sources+-+December+1%2C+2020&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=263043_1606885940043&amp;amp;bt_ee=mhaIKHqDqUOFYZqRBtVdURSVegAmuWiIhR%2BTCkDD6htJyK2BpZ9oRbz%2Bl37uox6h&amp;amp;bt_ts=1606885940043\"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; CNNâs &lt;strong&gt;Brian Stelter&lt;/strong&gt;, as evidenced by the various attacks leveled against the attorney general on Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Newsmax host &lt;strong&gt;Greg Kelly&lt;/strong&gt;, whose willingness to promote Trumpâs post-election falsehoods has contributed to a dramatic ratings &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/fox-news-vs-newsmax-heating-up\"&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; for the network, said he âcanât believeâ if Barr âlooked for voter fraud he wouldnât find any,â adding: &amp;quot;Some of us are wondering if he is a warrior with the Constitution or if he&amp;#39;s just a bureaucrat.â The Gateway Pundit, a far-right website that Trump often amplifies on Twitter, skewered Barr as a âfraudâ whose âmasquerade as someone opposed to the criminality of the Deep State&amp;quot; had been &amp;quot;exposed as a venal lie.â &lt;strong&gt;Mark Levin&lt;/strong&gt;, a far-right radio host, called Barrâs comments âmisleading.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The backlash reflects the dilemma right-wing outlets face after a Trump associate they&amp;#39;ve previously extolled counters the president&amp;#39;s disinformation: acknowledge reality, or dive deeper into the conspiratorial hole. Many of the presidentâs media allies took the latter route and portrayed Barr telling the truth as a betrayal. &amp;quot;For the attorney general of the United States to make that statement&amp;#8212;he is either a liar or a fool or both,&amp;quot; Fox Business host &lt;strong&gt;Lou Dobbs&lt;/strong&gt; said, describing Barr as having &amp;quot;appeared to join in with the radical Dems and the deep-state and the resistanceâ and even suggesting the attorney general was âperhaps compromised.â By contrast, Fox News opinion stars &lt;strong&gt;Tucker Carlson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sean Hannity&lt;/strong&gt; refrained from attacking Barr on Tuesday night, CNN reports. While Fox hosts such as Carlson and &lt;strong&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/strong&gt; have at times suggested an interest in &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/fox-news-hosts-still-think-trump-can-win\"&gt;moving on&lt;/a&gt; from Trumpâs doomed campaign to overturn the results and secure another four years, Hannity and others have continued to boost the presidentâs conspiracy theories and election denial, an &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/fox-news-hosts-still-think-trump-can-win\"&gt;internal split&lt;/a&gt; playing out on the network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly four years after &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; moved into the White House, there are a number of things weâve come to expect from the administration, whose incompetence, chaos, and self-dealing is actually quite predictable. We can expect that the president will spend a significant portion of his day tweeting incomprehensible attacks on people deemed disloyal. We can expect that &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Miller&lt;/strong&gt; will actively &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/stephen-miller-separated-children-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hatch&lt;/a&gt; unique ways to make immigrantsâ lives hell. And we can expect that, given the opportunity, Trump and his children will do everything they can to profit off the presidency, no matter how transparently shady and corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, really, it was only a matter of time before we learned that businesses owned by Trump and by his son-in-lawâs family received millions of dollars in pandemic relief loans. Or that, despite the fact that the money was in large part meant to keep employees from being laid off, only a handful of employees at Trump and Kushner&amp;#8211;owned companies were kept on the payroll. Per &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/release-ppp-loan-recipients-data-reveals-troubling-patterns-n1249629\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SweepingÂ [analysis of] data released by the Small Business Administrationâ¦found that properties owned by the Trump Organization as well as the Kushner Companies, owned by the family of &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt;, President Donald Trumpâs son-in-law and senior adviser, profited from the program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over 25 PPP loans worth more than $3.65 million were given to businesses with addresses at Trump and Kushner real estate properties, paying rent to those owners. Fifteen of the properties self-reported that they only kept one job, zero jobs, or did not report a number at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump, of course, chose not to divest from his company upon becoming president, and continues to profit from it&amp;#8212;profits that have gotten a nice boost thanks to his insistence on &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/key-charges-trump-properties/2020/10/27/bfa39b08-16cd-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; foreign leaders at his properties, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/trump-organization-secret-service-bills\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;gouging the Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;, and charging taxpayers &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-water\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;for water he drinks at Mar-a-Lago&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. Kushner, along with &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-financial-disclosure.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; at least $36 million last year, largely through his stake in his familyâs real estate firm. (In 2017, the duo &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-financial-disclosure.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; income of at least $82 million, so times are obviously tough.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to revealing the loans to the Trump and Kushner businesses, the PPP data showed ridiculous mismanagement of the program, with over 100 loans going to companies with no name listed and other companies appearing to game the system for loans as high as $10 million through their subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The PPP programsâ original stated intent by officials was to help with payroll for small businesses struggling under the effects of coronavirus lockdown measuresâ¦. But almost from the start, the programs, particularly PPP, drew criticism for how they were administered and messaged, and whether it was equitable. Large national banks initially gave loans only to customers with whom they had pre-existing lending relationships. Businesses owned by people of color without strong banking relationshipsÂ found themselves with limited accessÂ and forced them to find other routes for funding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There was also the persistent question of what defined a âsmall business,â after lobbying by the hotel and restaurant industry ballooned the maximum number of employees allowable to 500, even though over 98 percent of the small businesses in America have fewer than 100 employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âMany months and broken promises later, the court-ordered release of this crucial data while the Trump administration is one foot out the door is a shameful dereliction of duty and flagrant mismanagement of a program that millions of workers and small businesses needed to get through this pandemic,â &lt;strong&gt;Kyle Herrig&lt;/strong&gt;, president of Accountable.US, an accountability watchdog, said in a statement. But Trump and Kushner got their money so, six of one, half a dozen of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, clickÂ &lt;a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;Â to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

really, this would probably be the first for many people&amp;#8212;itâs âsmug asshole.â True to his MO, thatâs the exact energy Mnuchin brought to his hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to discuss his attempt to strip Americans of much needed pandemic relief. But unfortunately for the Treasury chief, it was no match for Representative &lt;strong&gt;Katie Porter,&lt;/strong&gt; whoâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a34220100/rep-katie-porter-whiteboard/\"&gt;eviscerated&lt;/a&gt; more than her fair share of smug assholes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Referring to Mnuchinâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/steven-mnuchin-joe-biden-economy\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; to make the Federal Reserve, &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/economy/mnuchin-fed-emergency-programs.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;against its will&lt;/a&gt;, return hundreds of billions of dollars that were designated for emergency COVID-19 lending programs, and place them in the Treasuryâs general fund where his successor &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/ivanka-trump-dow-greenhouse-gasses-tweets\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;cannot tap them&lt;/a&gt; without congressional approval, Porter &lt;a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/2020/12/congresswoman-katie-porter/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the secretary: âIâm reading aloud now from Section 4027 of the Cares Act. âOn or after January 1, 2026, any funds that are remaining shall be transferred to the general fund.â In other words, sent back to the Treasury. Secretary Mnuchin, is it currently the year 2026, yes or no?â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mnuchin, who &lt;a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/664570/trumps-reported-pick-treasury-secretary-former-goldman-sachs-partner-who-drove-porsche-college\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;drove a Porsche as an undergrad&lt;/a&gt; at Yale and has seemingly been this way for his entire life, initially failed to answer the question and then, after it was asked again, sneered, âOf course itâs not 2026. How ridiculous to ask me that question and waste our time.â While he presumably thought that would be the end of that, Porter was only getting started. âWell, Secretary Mnuchin,â she said, âI think itâs ridiculous that youâre play-acting to be a lawyer when you have no legal degree.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responding as only someone whoâs probably uttered the words âmy maid makes more in a year than you will your entire life,â Mnuchin shot back, âWell, actually, I have plenty of lawyers at the Department of Treasury who advise me,â adding that they would âexplain all the legal provisions.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âSecretary Mnuchin, are you in fact a lawyer?â Porter continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âI do not have a legal degree, I have lawyers [who] report to me,â Mnuchin answered, with characteristic condescension.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Porter then turned to Fed chair &lt;strong&gt;Jerome Powell&lt;/strong&gt; and, confirming he does have a law degree, told Mnuchin, âOkay, so Secretary Mnuchin, you are trying to tell Chairman Powell to send over any remaining funds right now, and youâre claiming falsely, in my opinion, that that is what the law says.â Mnuchin responded by asking Porter, who &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidgura/status/1334172687942492170\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum laude&lt;/a&gt;

on the eighth floor of the State Department involving hundreds of guests, food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pompeoâs lineup of parties in the next three weeks comes as the Trump administrationâs own health experts are imploring Americans to limit travel and avoid large gatherings amid aÂ pandemicÂ that hasÂ killed more than 270,000 AmericansÂ and infected nearly 14Â million across the United Statesâ¦. President Trump is alsoÂ hosting holiday partiesÂ at the White House that defy his own health expertsâ public guidance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked about the super-spreader event waiting to happen, a State Department spokesperson &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/pompeo-coronavirus-holiday-parties/2020/12/02/9a06d0a6-3421-11eb-afe6-e4dbee9689f8_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; âWe plan to fully enforce social distancing measures at this reception, and face coverings are mandatory for admittance.â Asked how attendees could keep their mask on at a party that includes food and drink, or socially distance when there are 900 invited guests, the spokesman did not have answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A day after Justice Dept. found no evidence of widespread election fraud, Trump posts 45-minute video filled with falsehoods.

Carter&lt;/strong&gt; had his peanut farm. The Bush family had its oil interests. But there was really &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/09/trumps-conflicts-of-interest-are-without-precedent-in-american-presidential-history/\"&gt;no precedent&lt;/a&gt; for the shady and complex web of business interests &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; brought into the White House with him four years ago. Not only did he never untangle himself from his personal interests; over the course of four tumultuous years, he actively blurred the line between the personal, professional, and political until there was no distinguishing between the three. If his presidency was unprecedented, so, too, will his post-presidency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump never really left his financial interests behind. But when he leaves office next month, heâll once again be the face of his family business&amp;#8212;and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/01/trump-foreign-real-estate-441928\"&gt;according to Politico&lt;/a&gt;, thatâll mean a quick return to making foreign real estate deals, raising novel ethical concerns. âThe president does not feel bound by actual legal prohibitions, much less merely ethical or moral ones,â Congressman &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Raskin&lt;/strong&gt;, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told the outlet. âWe can expect that he will continue to operate his business in conjunction with foreign businesses and governments.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Buried in debt, and with a brand inextricably linked in the United States to his toxic politics, Trump is expected to consider or pursue real estate ventures in India, China, Turkey, and other countries after leaving office, sources familiar with his thinking told Politico. âHeâll do what he does,â former Trump executive &lt;strong&gt;Barbara Res&lt;/strong&gt; said. That tracks with what his sons, who have nominally been in charge of the family business while their dad was in office, have publicly said on the matter. âAfter politics,â &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/india-to-be-a-big-focus-post-politics-says-trump-jr-1568399340863.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; an Indian newspaper last year, âwe would certainly look at India and other markets.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the post-presidency tends to be a cushy gig for those who occupied the Oval Office&amp;#8212;replete with paid speeches and big dollar book deals&amp;#8212;Trump will do what no other president has done before, inviting criticism that his projects could be used to âpay back Trump for his policies as president or to influence U.S. policy through a former president,â as Politico put it. And, of course, that all becomes more complicated if Trump runs again in 2024, as he has &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/if-trump-runs-in-2024-he-may-launch-his-campaign-on-bidens-inauguration-day\"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; at.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;âThere are some boundaries that didnât exist before,â Democratic Congressman &lt;strong&gt;Gerry Connolly&lt;/strong&gt; of the House Oversight Committee told the outlet. âAnd I have no doubt that he will blow past those boundaries and not respect any of them.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/trump-has-done-a-great-job-profiting-off-the-presidency\"&gt;success&lt;/a&gt; Trump apparently had profiting off the presidency the past four years, itâs not particularly surprising that he would continue to wield it to his benefit as he leaves office and after. Already heâs been using his dead-end battle to overturn the election results to &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/trump-supporters-donate-millions-legal-challenges-election\"&gt;wring money&lt;/a&gt; out of his supporters. But he likely hopes that what that scheme ultimately yields will look like small change compared with his post-presidency ventures. âWhat Trump is doing is trying to make a vast fortune, which has never been tried before, parlaying his presidency into massive amounts of money abroad,â presidential historian &lt;strong&gt;Douglas Brinkley&lt;/strong&gt; told Politico. âIâve never seen anything like it.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

the tradition of choosing godparents is widespread, &lt;strong&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/strong&gt;âs role at the head of the Church of England makes the tradition especially important in the royal family. Recently the family has also found ways to emphasize their personal relationships and passions, choosing honored friends or particularly important mentors. One of the earliest examples of that came when &lt;strong&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/strong&gt; and Princess Diana chose &lt;strong&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/strong&gt;âs six godparents and included Dianaâs former roommate &lt;strong&gt;Carolyn Bartholomew&lt;/strong&gt; and Lady Celia Vestey, a member of the queenâs inner circle. On November 28, Celia passed away âsuddenly, but peacefullyâ at the age of 71, according to her familyâs notice in the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph.&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports that &lt;a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13344927/prince-harry-godmother-dies-lady-celia-vestey/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Harry has contacted her children&lt;/a&gt; to share his condolences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She was the wife of &lt;strong&gt;Sam, Lord Vestey,&lt;/strong&gt; one of Englandâs richest businessmen, but her connection to the royals came through her love for horses, and from 1999 to 2018, Sam served as the Master of Horses for the royal household. In 1985, after Harry was born, &lt;strong&gt;Tina Brown&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/1985/10/the-mouse-that-roared\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Celia was one of the few people who was friends with both Charles and Diana. Ultimately it was an apt choice; Celia was known for her good-spirited humor, and she led a life that straddled the paths that each one of Harryâs parents wanted to take. Celiaâs sons attended Harryâs prep school, andÂ according to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-9004941/Prince-Harrys-godmother-Lady-Vestey-died-aged-71.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the two stayed in touch throughout his life. She was a guest at his 2018 wedding to &lt;strong&gt;Meghan Markle&lt;/strong&gt; and also made an appearance at &lt;strong&gt;Prince William&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kate Middleton&lt;/strong&gt;âs 2011 nuptials.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Celiaâs parents, Major Guy Knight and his wife Hester, were both born to prominent families, and her father won a military cross for his bravery during World War II. Celia was born in 1949, and in the early 1950s, the family began to manage the farmland at Lockinge Manor. Celiaâs sister, &lt;strong&gt;Henrietta Knight,&lt;/strong&gt; writes &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Not_Enough_Time/tQyiCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;in her memoir&lt;/a&gt; that their love for horses began early on. They both had their own ponies at a young age, and their mother began to breed Shetlands while they were still teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Celia first entered the royal fold because the Queen Mother was &lt;a href=\"https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/6603828.queen-mother-mourns/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;close friends&lt;/a&gt; with her parents and would come to dine at Lockinge every summer. When Henrietta became a professional trainer, she struck up a correspondence with the Queen Mother and was occasionally invited to spend weekends at Royal Lodge, her Windsor home, to attend lavish dinner parties. Celia never spoke publicly about her relationship to the Queen Mother, but in 1975, she was a part of the familyâs procession at Royal Ascot. Though they wouldnât meet until later, Sam was also a part of the royal pack that came together over their love for riding, hunting, and playing polo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Celia trained as a nurse at Westminster Hospital and enjoyed living in London, but horse breeding was still her passion. In a 1981 BBC documentary, she was filmed with the horse she would let occasionally let roam inside her house. âI wouldnât let just any horse inside,â she said, according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. âHe usually comes in once a week while we are having coffee.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She was still a nurse when &lt;strong&gt;Robert Fellowes,&lt;/strong&gt; a brother-in-law of Diana, introduced her to Sam. After Samâs first marriage ended in divorce, his best friend Fellowes invited Celia to a dinner party, which was a success. In 1996, she told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; that their first romantic moment took place at a dance held to celebrate Charles and Dianaâs wedding in 1981. âThe Queen gave a dance before Prince Charles married Lady Di and I met Sam on the stairs going up to say âhow do you doâ to the Queen. A regimental band was playing,â she said. âI was wearing some old, clapped-out long dress, nothing glamorous, but he danced with me all night.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Celia went to visit Sam at his house, Stowell Park, for the first time, she brought her favorite horse (also named Sam) along because she didnât want to be separated from the horse for too long. âOn Sunday we were in the car coming back from church and he asked me to marry him,â she said. âWe actually courted, got engaged, and married in four months.â Though they would later attend some of the royal familyâs most spectacular weddings, they opted for something much smaller themselves. Celia wore a somber black velvet gown to a simple ceremony at the Wantage Register Office, near her parentsâ house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the wedding, they decided to combine their horse-breeding operations at Stowell, and Sam eventually became the head of the Cheltenham racecourse, which hosts an annual horse festival beloved by the royals. They saw success with their breeding operation, and Celia even sent a horse to compete for Britain at the Olympics. One year, a horse bred by Celia, owned by Sam, and trained by Henrietta won a competitive race with the Queen Mother watching along. âIt was a truly family affair and a magic moment,â Sam told the &lt;em&gt;Gloucestershire Echo&lt;/em&gt; in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The couple went on to have three children. In November 1995, Celia suffered a life-threatening hemorrhagic stroke that left her with weakness on her left side and temporarily slurred speech. The next spring, she praised Sam for his support. âA friend of ours said Sam never ever let it enter his mind that he might lose me, though he knew I was incredibly ill and living on a knife edge,â she said. âIt has made me realize how much he loves me and I became fantastically possessive. I was terrified to let him out of my sight. I couldnât understand why I was like that because Iâm not a possessive person.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They eventually became close to the queen and last year, Sam became one of her permanent Lords-in-Waiting. Over the last few years, they were occasional weekend guests at Windsor and in 2016, a source told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; that the queen was âfondâ of Celiaâs âlively company.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In her first interview after her stroke, she lamented above all that she wouldnât be able to attend the annual festival at Cheltenham, but replied with wisdom fit for the royal family. âThe thing I have learned is that you really cannot ever predict what is going to happen,â she said. âYou never know what is round the corner of your life.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity

the unseasonably warm afternoon of Saturday, November 7, &lt;strong&gt;Mary L. Trump&lt;/strong&gt; was in her beachfront condo overlooking Cape Cod Bay when the news flashed across her TV screen. Four days after the polls had closed, the Associated Press finally called the election for &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; heralding an end to the preternaturally bonkers presidency of Maryâs uncle and bÃªte noire, &lt;strong&gt;Donald J. Trump.&lt;/strong&gt; Mary picked up her phone and texted her daughter, who rang mom right away so they could share what was, for them and at least 80.9 million other Americans, a moment of immense happiness. Then Mary grabbed a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and hit the beach, where she drained her Champagne glass while basking in the near-75-degree mid-autumn sunshine. âI just felt this energy that I havenât felt in a while,â she told me this week. âThe sense of relief I felt was just so incredible.âÂ &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the factors that contributed to Trumpâs close but decisive defeat&amp;#8212;his administrationâs feckless approach to the pandemic; the desire of certain swing state voters to see a sense of normalcy restored to the White House&amp;#8212;Mary might have played at least a small role. Over the summer her best-selling book for Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, &lt;em&gt;Too Much and Never Enough,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/a-conclusive-diagnosis-of-donald-trumps-psychopathology\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;gave readers a damning portrait&lt;/a&gt; of Trumpâs troubled upbringing and complex psychopathology. It was a compelling narrative buoyed by her Ph.D. in clinical psychology and rooted in her lifelong experience as a member of the âdysfunctionalâ (Maryâs word) Trump family&amp;#8212;a ringside perspective to which even the best journalistic tell-all could not lay claim. To date, more than 1.2 million copies have been sold, according to NPD BookScan, and as of this week, &lt;em&gt;Too Much and Never Enough&lt;/em&gt; was number one on &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/2020/books/ref=zg_bs_tab_t_bsar\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Amazonâs list of 2020 best sellers&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt;âs just-released memoir nipping at its heels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now Mary plans to apply her clinical training to another literary pursuit, one that will continue grappling with her uncleâs dramatic and, very likely, long-lasting impact on American politics and society. Announced Tuesday by Macmillanâs St. Martinâs Press, and scheduled to hit shelves on July 20, &lt;em&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/em&gt; âwill examine,â &lt;a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/the-reckoning/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;according to the promotional copy&lt;/a&gt;, âAmericaâs national trauma, rooted in our history but dramatically exacerbated by the impact of current events and the Trump administrationâs corrupt and immoral policies.... Whether it manifests itself in rising levels of rage and hatred, or hopelessness and apathy, the stress of living in a country we no longer recognize has affected all of us. America is suffering from PTSD.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mary called me Tuesday afternoon to talk about it&amp;#8212;and lots of other things too. Like, for instance, what she predicts for Trump and his children after the curtain falls on the 45th presidency. Hereâs a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You could have just faded back out of the spotlight after the election. Aside from the financial incentive, what made you want to do another book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Trump:&lt;/em&gt; The fact of the matter is, the work isnât done. Thereâs never any way to know how a book is going to be received, so the first one was certainly risky. There was a lot of downside, and no way to know if there was going to be an upside. But it seems to have broken through and landed in aÂ way I didnât anticipate it would, and so thatâs been really gratifying. And now I have a platform. We are going to continue to be in so much trouble, and if I can continue to be of use and be helpful, thatâs what I should do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess the book is going to answer this, but how&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;we recover from our collective PTSD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Itâs so complicated because first of all, the trauma is the history of this country in some ways, so we kind of need to go back so we can understand why we were so vulnerable, why we continue in large measure to make the wrong decisions, and why we fail to do the things that could protect us from these situations, why we seem never to learn the lessons that we should have learned. There is this overarching historical perspective that needs to be examined. Weâre going to have to hit the ground running as hard as possible. Luckily, with the incoming administration, we will have an opportunity to do that now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talk about âthe stress of living in a country we no longer recognize.â Do you think weâll start to recognize it more under a Biden presidency, or have we crossed the point of no return?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It depends on who youâre talking about. There are people among us who have always existed&amp;#8212;unrepentant racists, white supremacists, people who are hateful and nothing you say is gonna change their mind, nothing the government does to make their lives better is gonna convince them the government isnât out to get them. The problem is, under this current administration, theyâve been activated and represented in a way they never have been before. Then thereâs the other people among the 73 million who voted for Donald, which, letâs be clear, thatâs a horrific number, but a lot of those people after the inauguration will say, âOkay, Bidenâs my president. You win some, you lose some,â and hopefully their lives will get better and theyâll see that the last four years were something we can avoid in the future if we put up certain safeguards. Living with these levels of stress, itâs incredibly unhealthy in all sorts of ways, and it isnât just COVID. It isnât just economic uncertainty and fear. We basically now live in fear of our fellow human beings, and on top of all that is this sense of betrayal. For some of us itâs the sense that we believed that our government was there to protect us and help us in tough times, and clearly that hasnât happened. In fact, the opposite is the case&amp;#8212;the government has actually made things worse.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For some of these people whose beliefs are so entrenched, youâre probably one of the last people theyâd be willing to listen to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have been very honest about my own politics, but I didnât feel like my last book was political. It was more about giving people information I didnât think they had four years ago. Similarly, I see this book as a way to force, or at least to encourage, this vitally important conversation about the countryâs mental health, or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youâve maintained a media profile since publishing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Too-Much-Never-Enough-Dangerous/dp/1982141468\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too Much and Never Enough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;***.*** &lt;strong&gt;What has your life been like behind the scenes? You put a target on your back by going public in the way that you did.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the book first came out, I took all the necessary precautions, and then something really weird happened, and itâs a sign of the times that I find this shocking: I didnât receive any threats of any kind, and I had people actively looking for me. Itâs quite remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout inset-right\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youâre still in litigation with the family. Where does that stand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I filed suit a couple of months ago alleging fraud over a partnership I was involved in, where they, as part of the settlement of my grandfatherâs estate, bought me out of my share, and thatâs what I filed suit about. Once we get over this one certain hurdle involving a statute of limitations, I think it will go pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatâs your relationship with the family like at this point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I donât have one. But then again, I didnât before I published the book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you still speak with your aunt, Maryanne Trump Barry, whose private conversations with you were essential to key parts of the book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For reasons, and I have no idea why, but in, Iâd say, June of 2018, she just kind of stopped talking to me.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think some people, given the negative things she had to say about her brother, and the fact that your recordings of those conversations became public, some people wondered whether sheâd quietly given you her blessing. Sounds like thatâs not the case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I donât think thatâs the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you think Trump was going to lose the election?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did. I also felt very strongly that a landslide victory was necessary, and we didnât get that. Thank goodness Joe Biden won as decisively as he did, but we really needed a repudiation of not just Donald, but the entire party that enabled him. Seventy-three million votes is insane. I donât understand how he got more than 20 million, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you think Trumpâs reaction to losing would be this extreme, that he and his people would be going to these extreme lengths to defy the reality of the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, Iâm not surprised by any of it. Iâm a little bit surprised, and I know I should have learned my lesson by now, but I am a little bit surprised that the Republican leadership has been so craven in its willingness to endanger our democracy and the sanctity of our voting system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think this is going to end? Will he grudgingly retreat to Mar-a-Lago, or will federal marshals have to drag him out of the White House?&lt;/strong&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, heâs already checked out. Two thousand people are dying every day, and heâs playing golf. I think heâs much more focused on what he can get in the next 50 days, what kinds of deals he can make. So far the likeliest scenario Iâve heard is that heâs gonna counterprogram the inauguration, maybe with a rally announcing his 2024 candidacy, which is a complete joke, or something like that.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout inset-left\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you predict from your uncle and his children over the next four years?&lt;/strong&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, as soon as Biden is inaugurated, Donald loses a huge amount of relevance, and therefore so do his children. I donât think they quite understand how badly damaged that brand is. Also, and this is what gives me some hope, Donald isnât just looking at lawsuits from me and &lt;strong&gt;E. Jean Carroll&lt;/strong&gt; and other people. Heâs also looking at serious exposure from banking institutions, which no longer have to protect him. And then of course thereâs the legal exposure. He is, and his children are, looking at potentially very serious charges&amp;#8212;tax fraud, money laundering, and what have you. I think the New York attorney general and Manhattan district attorney were very serious about pursuing these things all along, but I think Donald made the urgency of holding him accountable even greater just by his egregious behavior over the past several weeks. Theyâre gonna have their hands full.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything that frightens you about what they might still be capable of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Itâs not so much what they can do. Iâm more worried about what happens if heâs not held accountable, if theyâre not held accountable. I think that would be as damaging to this country as &lt;strong&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/strong&gt; staying majority leader in the long term, because then itâs just gonna happen again&amp;#8212;there will be a savvier politician paradingÂ as a populist who has the same autocratic tendencies, but heâs just better at it. And next time we wonât be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All products featured on&lt;/em&gt; Vanity Fair &lt;em&gt;are independently selected by our editors.

I feel like itâs not a huge priority to go and have a big wedding right now, thatâs not what life is about.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The singer previously confessed on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/jennifer-lopez-talks-about-life-under-quarantine-and-world-of-dance-83903045612\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May that she was âa little heartbrokenâ over postponing their wedding &amp;quot;because we did have some great plans. But Iâm also like, you know what? God has a bigger plan so we just have to wait and see. Maybe it&amp;#39;s going to be betterâ A bigger and better plan that could potentially include a shotgun Las Vegas ceremony as Rodriguez joked on &lt;a

Well. Okay. Alright! Wow. Here we go: The Christmas season is on at the White House and weâre packing people in for parties! Okay!! Sure!!!Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a video shared on Facebook by &lt;strong&gt;Pam Pollard,&lt;/strong&gt; a former Oklahoma Republican Party chair, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9008283/Trump-teases-2024-run-White-House-Christmas-party.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Daily Mail cut and published&lt;/a&gt;, a group that included Republican lawmakers gathered below a White House staircase this week as &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; descended from on high. One can hear a woman yell, âWe love you!â over and over as well as someone &lt;em&gt;coughing up a lung in the background&lt;/em&gt;. Itâs so dark and obvious it has to be a troll? Like someone canât actively have a heaving dry cough and go to an indoor Christmas party at the White House with 50 or so of your closest&amp;#8212;and I mean literally closest&amp;#8212;friends?Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melania Trump&lt;/strong&gt;âs spokesperson &lt;strong&gt;Stephanie Grisham&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/12/white-house-holiday-parties-covid-trump\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; this week that the organizers of the various holiday events at the White House would make some concessions to reality, like providing hand sanitizer and reducing guest lists. But that stuff doesnât matter much when you mash your body up against 20 other mostly mask-less Republicans in order to get a video of dear leader before he becomes a private citizen. Itâs like watching any show on television right now and seeing people justâ¦walkâ¦into a room andâ¦hugâ¦the other people in it without even a brief pause. Except these people should know better. They should know anything at all.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there was Trump above his simpering, sardine-like followers on the stairwell (to quote a colleague, for a man who professes to have seen and enjoyed &lt;a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-loves-evita-presidency/story?id=59350378\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evita&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; that guy really spends &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/donald-trump-looked-directly-at-the-eclipse\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a lot of time&lt;/a&gt; speaking down to his subjects on balconies). Trump used the opportunity to pledge that heâll always contest the results, though he does not say whether or not he and his crack team of lawyers will ever offer any legitimate evidence of fraud.Â &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His exact words were, âWe are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, Iâll see you in four years.â Hm, weird to issue threats over the holidays, but this is the man who is forever the business dad from all those movies&amp;#8212;except heâs incapable of learning the true meaning of Christmas. The true meaning of Christmas is, remember, something something, love your son, something something, work less, something something, help save Santa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;

that everyone seems to have their own fashion, beauty, and skincare lines, celebrities have pivoted their attention to a whole new luxury market they can capitalize on&amp;#8212;candles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Right on the heels of &lt;strong&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s Tuesday &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CIOsO9wg8p9/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that he&amp;#39;s partnered with Byredo on an out-of-this-world fragrance and candle called &amp;quot;Space Rage,&amp;quot; his fellow rapper and âSicko Modeâ collaborator &lt;strong&gt;Drake&lt;/strong&gt; revealed today that he&amp;#39;s also getting into the fragrance business by teaming up with Revolve. While the debut of this new venture might seem a little sudden, the musician has actually been plotting his foray into the world of home fragrances for a minute, first teasing the brand on his Instagram Stories back in July. While he&amp;#39;s already gifted the candles to some of &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheWarriorsTalk/status/1283842784286277632\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;his famous friends&lt;/a&gt;, the candles are now available to the public just in time for the holidays, although already totally sold out. The high-end votives, sold under the label &lt;a href=\"https://betterworldfragrancehouse.co/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Better World Fragrance House&lt;/a&gt; and retailing for $80 apiece, come in five scents: &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-muskoka/dp/BWOR-WA3/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA3&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Muskoka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-good-thoughts/dp/BWOR-WA4/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA4&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Good Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-williamsburg-sleepover/dp/BWOR-WA1/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA1&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Williamsburg Sleepover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/better-world-fragrance-house-luxury-scented-candle-in-sweeter-tings/dp/BWOR-WA2/?d=Womens&amp;amp;product=BWOR-WA2&amp;amp;bneEl=false&amp;amp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sweeter Tings&lt;/a&gt;, and Carby Musk, which &amp;quot;actually smells like Drake,â according to the product description.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, selling a candle based on your own scent is a classic &lt;strong&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/strong&gt; move. This summer, the actress turned wellness guru capitalized off the success of &lt;a href=\"https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/this-smells-like-my-vagina-candle?country=USA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;âThis Smells Like My Vagina,â&lt;/a&gt; her lifestyle brand Goop&amp;#39;s $75 candle that sold out in a matter of hours, by announcing &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/gwyneth-paltrow-orgasm-candle\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the release of her second scent&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;a href=\"https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/this-smells-like-my-orgasm-candle?taxon_id=1867&amp;amp;country=USA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;âThis Smells Like My Orgasm.â&lt;/a&gt; Since Paltrow first introduced her yoni-inspired business venture and everyone now spends the majority of their life indoors thanks to the pandemic, a number of other stars have jumped on the candle trend, including &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Hopkins, Alicia Keys, Kylie Jenner&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Kacey Musgraves&lt;/strong&gt;. But when it comes to self-scented and female anatomy-based fragrances, &lt;strong&gt;Erykah Badu&lt;/strong&gt; may have both Drake and the Goop progenitor beat with &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/02/erykah-badu-incense\"&gt;the launch of her own incense&lt;/a&gt; in February unambiguously dubbed âBadu&amp;#39;s

12 hours ago we wrote about the prospect of &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; âpreemptivelyâ pardoning his adult children, after &lt;strong&gt;Sean Hannity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/donald-trump-family-pardons\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt; him to âpardon his whole family and himself.â At the time it was merely a theoretical piece of advice from a Fox News anchor and not something the president was reported to actually be considering. But surprise: He is! And knowing him, heâll probably go through with it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In an updated story about &lt;strong&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/strong&gt; having discussed the prospect of a âpreemptiveâ pardon for himself, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-pardon.html?referringSource=articleShare\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Trump has talked to advisers about granting the same sort of all-inclusive pardon to &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Eric Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner.&lt;/strong&gt; (As has been the story of her life, there was sadly no mention of &lt;strong&gt;Tiffany Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; though in this case that may be an unintended compliment re: her not needing to worry about being prosecuted.) Trump has reportedly told people that he is concerned that âa Biden Justice Department might seek retribution against the president by targeting the oldest three of his five children,â as well as Ivankaâs husband. Of course previous outgoing administrations havenât had to worry about such things, and thatâs because they werenât known for being crime syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of legal exposure, Don Jr. was under investigation by &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller&lt;/strong&gt; during the Russia probe for contacts heâd had with Russians offering damning information about &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/strong&gt; during the 2016 campaign. While Muellerâs team considered charging Trump campaign officials in connection with the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, Don Jr. ultimately got off, not because he hadnât done some exceedingly sketchy stuff, but because Mueller &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/mueller-report-confirms-don-jr-too-stupid-to-collude-with-russia\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; he was too stupid to understand he was committing a crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With regard to the Boy Prince of New Jersey, Kushner provided federal authorities with false information about his contacts with foreigners when applying for his security clearance&amp;#8212;which can be charged as a federal crime&amp;#8212;though the president just decided to give him one anyway. When it comes to Eric, who is running the Trump Organization alongside his older brother in their fatherâs absence, he recently &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/05/politics/eric-trump-deposition-nyag/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;sat down&lt;/a&gt; for a deposition as part of the New York attorney generalâs investigation into whether the family business falsely inflated the value of its assets to secure loans and tax benefits. And on the Princess Purses front, the Manhattan District Attorneyâs Office has expanded its probe of the Trump Organization to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in âconsulting fees,â some of which seemingly went to Ivanka, who was very much an employee of the company and not a consultant. (The first daughter did not &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/ivanka-trump-donald-trump-tax-fraud\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;react well&lt;/a&gt; to this news last month.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Largely, though, it seems like Trump, the biggest grifter in presidential history, would like to pardon his children and son-in-law not just for any crimes they might have committed in the past, but any future ones too. As the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; notes, no president has ever attempted to pardon someone âfor crimes they have not yet committed&amp;#8212;essentially a prospective get-out-of-jail-free card,â and, unsurprisingly, legal experts believe such an action would be unlikely âto hold any weight.â But if anyone is going to try, itâs definitely this guy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in related, shocking news, given the stellar reputations of the people Donald J. Trump surrounds himself with, thereâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/politics/presidential-pardon-justice-department/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House or related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon,Â according to court records unsealed TuesdayÂ in federal court.... According to the court records, at the end of this summer, a filter team, used to make sure prosecutors donât receive tainted evidence that should have been kept from them because it was privileged, had more than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives, and computer drives after investigators raided the unidentified offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors told the court they wanted permission to the filter teamâs holdings. The prosecutors believed the devices revealed emails that showed allegedly criminal activity, including a âsecret lobbying schemeâ and a bribery conspiracy that offered âa substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentenceâ for a convicted defendant whose name is redacted, according to the redacted documents.... The White House declined to comment on the court filing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump has so far granted 29 pardons, including one last week for disgraced former national security adviser &lt;strong&gt;Mike Flynn,&lt;/strong&gt; for lying to the FBI, undisclosed lobbying work for Turkey, and âthe waterfront of potential related crimes that Flynn could have faced in the future.â As for his kids, ABC News &lt;a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-vetting-pardon-requests-push-trump-preemptively/story?id=74482289\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that âthe push for preemptive pardons began early this yearâ around the time of Trumpâs impeachment trial. At the time the discussions were, according to sources, âa series of hypotheticals,â though they have apparently since gained concrete urgency given Trumpâs loss to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

General &lt;strong&gt;William Barr&lt;/strong&gt; dealt a serious blow to &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;âs baseless allegations of election fraud, saying Tuesday that the Justice Department had not found sufficient evidence that would shift the results of the 2020 race. âTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,â Barr &lt;a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press, reiterating what judges and election officials across the aisle have said amid Trumpâs effort to undermine the results and reverse his loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the Trump campaign suffering repeated courtroom defeats, and the fact that GOP governors and secretaries of state have certified President-elect &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/strong&gt;âs win in key swing states, the admission from one of the presidentâs most fervent allies&amp;#8212;who has &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/06/botched-friday-night-massacre-barr-fails-to-oust-us-attorney-whos-thorn-in-trumps-side\"&gt;drawn&lt;/a&gt;

of independence&amp;#8212;was especially notable, disputing not only Trumpâs post-election fantasy but also the right-wing media pushing his narrative. âFor weeks, these media personalities have strung their audiences along, suggesting that damning proof of fraud was just around the corner. Which is why the comment from Barr stung so bad,â &lt;a href=\"https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1606885940041f18317146c30/raw?utm_term=1606885940041f18317146c30&amp;amp;utm_source=Reliable+Sources+-+December+1%2C+2020&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=263043_1606885940043&amp;amp;bt_ee=mhaIKHqDqUOFYZqRBtVdURSVegAmuWiIhR%2BTCkDD6htJyK2BpZ9oRbz%2Bl37uox6h&amp;amp;bt_ts=1606885940043\"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; CNNâs &lt;strong&gt;Brian Stelter&lt;/strong&gt;, as evidenced by the various attacks leveled against the attorney general on Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Newsmax host &lt;strong&gt;Greg Kelly&lt;/strong&gt;, whose willingness to promote Trumpâs post-election falsehoods has contributed to a dramatic ratings &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/fox-news-vs-newsmax-heating-up\"&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; for the network, said he âcanât believeâ if Barr âlooked for voter fraud he wouldnât find any,â adding: &amp;quot;Some of us are wondering if he is a warrior with the Constitution or if he&amp;#39;s just a bureaucrat.â The Gateway Pundit, a far-right website that Trump often amplifies on Twitter, skewered Barr as a âfraudâ whose âmasquerade as someone opposed to the criminality of the Deep State&amp;quot; had been &amp;quot;exposed as a venal lie.â &lt;strong&gt;Mark Levin&lt;/strong&gt;, a far-right radio host, called Barrâs comments âmisleading.â&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The backlash reflects the dilemma right-wing outlets face after a Trump associate they&amp;#39;ve previously extolled counters the president&amp;#39;s disinformation: acknowledge reality, or dive deeper into the conspiratorial hole. Many of the presidentâs media allies took the latter route and portrayed Barr telling the truth as a betrayal. &amp;quot;For the attorney general of the United States to make that statement&amp;#8212;he is either a liar or a fool or both,&amp;quot; Fox Business host &lt;strong&gt;Lou Dobbs&lt;/strong&gt; said, describing Barr as having &amp;quot;appeared to join in with the radical Dems and the deep-state and the resistanceâ and even suggesting the attorney general was âperhaps compromised.â By contrast, Fox News opinion stars &lt;strong&gt;Tucker Carlson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sean Hannity&lt;/strong&gt; refrained from attacking Barr on Tuesday night, CNN reports. While Fox hosts such as Carlson and &lt;strong&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/strong&gt; have at times suggested an interest in &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/fox-news-hosts-still-think-trump-can-win\"&gt;moving on&lt;/a&gt; from Trumpâs doomed campaign to overturn the results and secure another four years, Hannity and others have continued to boost the presidentâs conspiracy theories and election denial, an &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/fox-news-hosts-still-think-trump-can-win\"&gt;internal split&lt;/a&gt; playing out on the network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Great Stories From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ivanka and Jaredâs &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/for-jared-and-ivanka-post-white-house-future-is-an-island-alone?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Post&amp;#8211;White House Future&lt;/a&gt; Is an Island Alone&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Inside Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyleâs Supposed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/don-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-rnc?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RNC-Takeover Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Why Mike &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-election?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pompeoâs Postelection Trump Worship&lt;/a&gt; Carries Real Risks&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;#8212; Ivanka Trump Was My Best Friend.

gorgeous Scientologist named Nazanin Boniadi was allegedly selected by officials in the organization to be Tom Cruiseâs next girlfriend. Her never-before-told story&amp;#8212;of the months inseparable from the star (and his watchers), before she fell out of favor&amp;#8212;reveals a complex dynamic that also affected Cruise&amp;#39;s relationships with Nicole Kidman, PenÃ©lope Cruz, and, now, Katie Holmes. Maureen Orth investigates.","relId":"54cb00afb624d6910576fd40"},{"hed":"The Boy Who Would Be King","dek":"By the time Michael Jackson died, his unparalleled fame and dark troubles had locked him into a fragile shell. With her interviews and notes from the early chapters of the pop kingâs career, the author resurrects the innocent, ebullient, exploring youth as he confided his struggle to move beyond his family and take control of his art.","relId":"54cc23331ca1cf0a23adb862"},{"hed":"The Unsinkable Jennifer Aniston","dek":"The whole world watched as her âperfectâ marriage fell apart. Only her closest friends knew what really happened. Now, in Jennifer Anistonâs first interview since she split from Brad Pitt, she spills her heart, and some tears, to &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair,&lt;/em&gt; sharing her shock and confusion over Pittâs liaison with Angelina Jolie, her desire for a family, and her deep, conflicting emotions (anger, hurt, exasperation, tenderness) toward the man she still loves.","relId":"54cc22d9fde9250a6c418dbe"},{"hed":"Thoroughly Modern Whitney","dek":"Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. It may have seemed an odd match, the scrubbed pop beauty and the street-tough New Jacker.

Wrapping up months of interviews with the actorâs friends, colleagues, and women, Mark Seal reveals how the CBS sitcom brought out Sheenâs best and his darkest sides, while a volatile mix of porn actresses, network execs, sober coaches, and nearly $2-million-per-episode paychecks pushed the 45-year-old star over the edge.","relId":"54cc23092cba652122da0475"},{"hed":"Americaâs Sweetheart","dek":"After &lt;em&gt;Speed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;While You Were Sleeping&lt;/em&gt;, Sandra Bullockâs price soared, but her ego didnât.

As they remember, stardom was unlikely&amp;#8212;and irrelevant.","relId":"54cc23331ca1cf0a23adb866"},{"hed":"Jennifer Garnerâs Frank Talk About Kids, Men, and Ben Affleck","dek":"The silent center of a tabloid hurricane, Jennifer Garner is finally speaking out.

Then Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and a posse of enablers showed him there were no limits&amp;#8212;when it came to Vegas parties, high-stakes gambling, and beautiful women. Talking to an angry Merchant and to the mistresses who fed Woodsâs massive appetite for extramarital sex, the author dissects the ruin of a champion.","relId":"54cc230e2cba652122da04b2"},{"hed":"Maximum Meg","dek":"Behind the screen magic of Meg Ryanâs madcap smile and compelling\nvulnerability is a strong, pragmatic wife and mother who helped her\nhusband, Dennis Quaid, conquer his cocaine addiction.","relId":"57d6e04250198fb5285766c0"}],"modifiedAt":"April 24, 2018 1:36 pm","photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/09/12/57d6f8dbfd4a81567218712d_meg-ryan-may-1995-story.jpg","width":1440,"height":990,"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1440,"height":810,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":1440,"height":810}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":487,"height":865,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":143,"y":39,"height":865,"width":487}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":610,"height":610,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":81,"y":47,"height":610,"width":610}},"duration":null},"3:2":{"width":1440,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":1440,"height":960}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":582,"height":873,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":106,"y":65,"height":873,"width":582}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1320,"height":990,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":60,"y":0,"width":1320,"height":990}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":1440,"height":864,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":1440,"height":864}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1435,"height":615,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":2,"y":0,"width":1435,"height":615}},"duration":null}},"isProgrammatic":true,"revisionCreatedAt":"February 26, 2020 3:56 pm","meta":{"archived":false,"affiliatizable":false,"collectionName":"photos","publishable":false,"hierarchical":false,"hallable":true,"modelName":"photo","identifiable":false,"image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Chiara Marinai","generatedAltText":"Image may contain: Human, Person, Meg Ryan, Wedding, Robe, Wedding Gown, Fashion, Clothing, Gown, Apparel, Dance, and Ballet","filename":"meg-ryan-may-1995-story.jpg","organizationId":"4gKgcExWVbtxQKpGvgwhWNaTTr3V","cropMode":"TOP","altText":"This image may contain Human, Person, Wedding, Fashion, Clothing, Gown, Apparel, Wedding Gown, Robe, and Dance","title":"meg-ryan-may-1995-story.jpg","credit":"Photograph by Annie Leibovitz;
