We share information with analytics and advertising companies that may act as our processor and a controller in other instances. We work with other entities to perform research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish insights, presented as aggregated, de-identified, or non-personal data. Where we share information with a party that is not our service provider, such sharing is either at your direction or the direction of our Customers.

Integrations may include payment processing companies, background check and online assessment providers, communication providers, or other independent services Customer chooses to utilize our open API with.</p>

Please see “Your Data Rights” and “Your California Privacy Rights” for more information on how to exercise your right to optout.</p>
    <p><strong>Other parties when you give your consent </strong></p>
    <p>We may also share personal information where you provide your consent or post your information publicly.

    <p><strong>Other third parties where required by law</strong></p>

If you revoke your consent by deleting your account, your Profile will be removed from our job seeker server; however, revoking your consent will not remove applications you previously submit to employers or our aggregated, de-identified, or non-personal data.</p>
    <p><strong>Your data rights for information you submit to our Customers</strong></p>
    <p>Upon submission of a job application or making your information available to an employer (our Customer) , your information is controlled by that employer. In this regard, we are a data processor for personal information employers’ maintain in our servers, and we maintain limited rights to such data as permitted by our Customers’, to process as necessary to deliver the Services or support to Customers’, ensure safety and security of our Services, where necessary to protect our interests or the public interest, or as required by law.</p>
    <p>For these reasons, we are not in a position to directly handle data requests for data controlled by Customers. Customers may store personal information they receive from you on our servers or their own storage facilities. Customers control the types of personal information requested from you, how it’s used, who can access it, and how long they retain this personal information. Your data rights are subject to Customer internal policies and applicable law. You should contact the Customer regarding personal information they may hold about you and to exercise any data rights you may have. We will cooperate with such inquiry to the extent it is permitted under our confidentiality and privacy obligations.</p>
    <div class="nobreak">
    <h2>Retention and Removal.</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is considered active, to provide you or our Customers our services, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, investigate security incidents, prevent fraud and abuse, protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person, enforce our contractual agreements, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from messages or exercise your data rights</p>
    <p>Our retention policies and procedures are designed to help ensure our compliance with legal obligations and allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. We implement retention controls within the Services that Customers utilize to control their data retention periods.</p>
    <p>For personal information we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such information will not be kept for longer than necessary for the purpose, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request, and will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read.</p>
    <p>Upon deletion of a job seeker account or any data point within the job seeker account, it will be removed from our job seeker database; however, your data may persist elsewhere, such as applications you previously submit to Customers will persist until Customer disposal. Job seekers should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application. We may retain de-identified information after your account has been closed.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>You may be required to pay fees to access certain add-on features within the Services (“Add-On Service(s)”). Unless otherwise stated by NEOGOV, Add-On Services are governed by the NEOGOV Services Agreement terms most recently published prior to the purchase or renewal of an Add-On Service, as well as these Terms of Use, Service Specifications, and applicable Schedules incorporated therein (available at: <a href="https://www.neogov.com/service-specifications">https://www.neogov.com/service-specifications</a>). Where the terms of this Section conflict with the NEOGOV Services Agreement, this Section shall control. Add-On Services may only be available through one or more of our Services and Add-On Services may not be available for all End Users or Customers.</li>
                <li>Payment Authorization. You agree to pay to NEOGOV any fees for each Add-On Service you purchase in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Add-On Service. All Add-On Service fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If NEOGOV changes the fees for all or part of the Services, including by adding fees or charges, NEOGOV will provide you notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, NEOGOV may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Services to you.</li>
                <li>Payment Methods. By providing debit or credit card account information through or to the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (1) you are legally authorized to provide such information to us; (2) you are legally authorized to perform payments from the debit or credit card account(s); (3) the credit card information you provide is correct and you will promptly notify NEOGOV of any changes to such information; and (4) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to your use of such debit or credit card account(s) or applicable law. When you authorize a payment using a debit or credit card account via the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete a payment using the debit or credit card account. NEOGOV’s authorized third-party payment processor will charge the payment method you specified at the time of purchase. You authorize NEOGOV to charge all fees as described in these Terms of Use for the Services you select to that payment method, and you authorize our third-party payment processor to use information you provide to process payments, manage debit and credit card information and detect and prevent fraud.

If you decide to activate an Add-On Subscription, you authorize NEOGOV to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the recurring payments, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The Add-On Service Subscription Term is a continuous and non-divisible commitment for the full duration of the term regardless of any invoice schedule. The Subscription will commence upon the date you activate or use the Add-On Service. The Subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your Subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your Add-On Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). NEOGOV may change the Subscription Fee for any subsequent Subscription period but will provide you notice of any increase before it applies. Unless otherwise stated in a commercial agreement we negotiated with a Customer, you may cancel an Add-On Subscription by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:accounting@neogov.com">accounting@neogov.com</a>, <a href="mailto:customersupport@neogov.com">customersupport@neogov.com</a>, or alternative means expressly presented to you within the Services.
