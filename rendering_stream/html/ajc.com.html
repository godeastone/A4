Edwards won Common Cause Georgia’s Democracy Award for that work, as well as the AJC’s first Emmy.\nIn 2016, he served on the team behind the AJC’s Doctors &amp; Sex Abuse project, a Pulitzer finalist, and recorded a podcast series on a predator doctor the following year. \nEdwards led the newspaper’s 2019 coverage of the Georgia House speaker’s use of legislative leave to delay criminal cases for clients of his private law practice, which won an Atlanta Press Club award for investigative reporting.","twitter":"https://twitter.com/JohnEdwardsAJC","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-7209","books":[],"podcasts":[{"name":"Predator M.D.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/listen-season-the-ajc-breakdown-podcast/rtCTRJ8nFBzdyQMHbrTbMO/","download_url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/breakdown/id992983540?mt=2"}],"education":[],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2020-10-06T14:16:38.755Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/cb1a5283-c9c8-471c-991a-a1cfb33cfeae.png","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/johnny.r.edwards.9","location":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","expertise":"9","author_type":"Staff"}}}]},"description":{"basic":"An initial review by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of new PPP data found some big businesses scooping up large loans, and taxpayer money routed to some questionable companies.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 2001. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I began covering transportation. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year to cover nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added on film and have had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I love tennis, pop culture and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an English bulldog named Goo Goo and an adopted daughter named Vega.

But if Ann and Barbara would have attended private school anyway, and the state is now subsidizing their private school tuition instead of paying nothing, then state still saves $4,008 total on Curt and David but suffers a loss of two times the voucher cost (2 x $3,713) due to the Ann/Barbara subsidy, with a net calculated as $4,008 – $7,426 = -$3,418.

The answer takes us back to the QEE law itself, which appears to have been designed to cloak the fiscal effects and the academic effects of the voucher program. Regarding the latter, we do know from studies of more transparent voucher programs – in Louisiana, Indiana and Ohio – that students tend to suffer an &lt;a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/2017/7/12/21108235/do-school-vouchers-work-as-the-debate-heats-up-here-s-what-research-really-says\"&gt;academic disadvantage&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in math, when they receive the vouchers.

The second one is the linchpin of their analysis of fiscal benefits tied to graduation rates and college matriculation. The researchers were given some data from GOAL, the largest among the private organizations that receive the tax-credited donations and then hand out the vouchers. Those data are, I suppose, better than nothing – which is what the law generally offers in terms of transparency. But the one control variable provided and used is eligibility for “free or reduced price lunch” (FRL)."},{"_id":"LQMJBUEC35FRTMTHG73II2SI3A","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1606916557638},"content":"I should note here that the GOAL dataset apparently also included the race/ethnicity of the voucher recipients.

A &lt;a href=\"https://allongeorgia.com/georgia-education-k12/ga-dept-of-ed-releases-free-reduced-school-lunch-criteria/\"&gt;family of four&lt;/a&gt; qualifies for reduced-price lunch if its income is up to $47,638; it qualifies for free lunch if its income is from zero to $33,475. Since over 55% of all Georgia children are eligible for one or the other, merely controlling for overall FRL eligibility does little to account for the predictive value of family wealth in driving graduation rates and college matriculation. Given that the analyses also did not use the race/ethnicity variable, let alone non-available key predictors such as parental education, the causal inferences made by Erickson and Scafidi are simply not justified.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 2001. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I began covering transportation. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year to cover nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added on film and have had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I love tennis, pop culture and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an English bulldog named Goo Goo and an adopted daughter named Vega.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 2001. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I began covering transportation. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year to cover nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added on film and have had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I love tennis, pop culture and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an English bulldog named Goo Goo and an adopted daughter named Vega.

His work at the newspaper over the past decade has rooted out corruption and abuse, leading to changes in state law and federal investigations. \nEdwards previously worked at daily newspapers in Lynchburg, Va., and Augusta, Ga., and served time as an embedded reporter during the invasion of Iraq. He joined the AJC in 2010 as a local government reporter covering the state’s largest county, then joined the investigative team three years later.\nIn 2014, his reporting exposed how DeKalb County elected officials used their discretionary budgets for personal benefit, triggering an FBI investigation that resulted in criminal charges against a county commissioner and three other people.

He joined the AJC in 2010 as a local government reporter covering the state’s largest county, then joined the investigative team three years later.\nIn 2014, his reporting exposed how DeKalb County elected officials used their discretionary budgets for personal benefit, triggering an FBI investigation that resulted in criminal charges against a county commissioner and three other people. Edwards won Common Cause Georgia’s Democracy Award for that work, as well as the AJC’s first Emmy.\nIn 2016, he served on the team behind the AJC’s Doctors &amp; Sex Abuse project, a Pulitzer finalist, and recorded a podcast series on a predator doctor the following year. \nEdwards led the newspaper’s 2019 coverage of the Georgia House speaker’s use of legislative leave to delay criminal cases for clients of his private law practice, which won an Atlanta Press Club award for investigative reporting.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/johnny.r.edwards.9","affiliations":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","bio":"Johnny Edwards, a member of the AJC’s investigative team, covers the private sector and government regulation.","expertise":"9","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Johnny","twitter":"https://twitter.com/JohnEdwardsAJC","books":[],"podcasts":[{"name":"Predator M.D.","download_url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/breakdown/id992983540?mt=2","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/listen-season-the-ajc-breakdown-podcast/rtCTRJ8nFBzdyQMHbrTbMO/"}],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-7209","location":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","_id":"johnny-edwards","last_updated_date":"2020-10-06T14:16:38.755Z","byline":"Johnny Edwards","email":"johnny.edwards@ajc.com","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8"}]},"headlines":{"basic":"Forced release of federal data shows more bailout loans went to questionable players"},"description":{"basic":"An initial review by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of new PPP data found some big businesses scooping up large loans, and taxpayer money routed to some questionable companies.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and the 2020 legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol.

His work at the newspaper over the past decade has rooted out corruption and abuse, leading to changes in state law and federal investigations. \nEdwards previously worked at daily newspapers in Lynchburg, Va., and Augusta, Ga., and served time as an embedded reporter during the invasion of Iraq. He joined the AJC in 2010 as a local government reporter covering the state’s largest county, then joined the investigative team three years later.\nIn 2014, his reporting exposed how DeKalb County elected officials used their discretionary budgets for personal benefit, triggering an FBI investigation that resulted in criminal charges against a county commissioner and three other people. Edwards won Common Cause Georgia’s Democracy Award for that work, as well as the AJC’s first Emmy.\nIn 2016, he served on the team behind the AJC’s Doctors &amp; Sex Abuse project, a Pulitzer finalist, and recorded a podcast series on a predator doctor the following year. \nEdwards led the newspaper’s 2019 coverage of the Georgia House speaker’s use of legislative leave to delay criminal cases for clients of his private law practice, which won an Atlanta Press Club award for investigative reporting.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/johnny.r.edwards.9","affiliations":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","bio":"Johnny Edwards, a member of the AJC’s investigative team, covers the private sector and government regulation.","expertise":"9","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Johnny","twitter":"https://twitter.com/JohnEdwardsAJC","books":[],"podcasts":[{"name":"Predator M.D.","download_url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/breakdown/id992983540?mt=2","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/listen-season-the-ajc-breakdown-podcast/rtCTRJ8nFBzdyQMHbrTbMO/"}],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-7209","location":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","_id":"johnny-edwards","last_updated_date":"2020-10-06T14:16:38.755Z","byline":"Johnny Edwards","email":"johnny.edwards@ajc.com","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8"}]},"headlines":{"basic":"Forced release of federal data shows more bailout loans went to questionable players"},"description":{"basic":"An initial review by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of new PPP data found some big businesses scooping up large loans, and taxpayer money routed to some questionable companies.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and the 2020 legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya T.","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"headlines":{"basic":"Former marketing exec wins runoff for Atlanta-based state Senate seat"},"description":{"basic":""},"first_publish_date":"2020-12-02T05:10:00.005Z","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"path":"/politics","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Politics","description":"Political news with a Georgia focus, including the Georgia Legislature, Congress, White House, presidential elections and Georgia Congressional Districts.","_id":"/politics","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/","BottomNav":null,"TopNavRedesign":"/","TopNav":"/","ComposerNav":"/"},"site":{"site_url":"/politics/","section_comments_enabled":"Yes","site_description":"Political news with a Georgia focus, including the Georgia Legislature, Congress, White House, presidential elections and Georgia Congressional Districts.","site_title":"AJC Georgia Politics | What's really going on in politics"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Politics"},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Politics","Sponsor":{"sponsor_url_open_new_tab":"true","sponsor_desktop_banner":"","sponsor_mobile_banner":"","sponsor_url":""},"_id":"/politics","ancestors":{"TopNavRedesign":["/"],"TopNav":["/"]},"order":{"default":1022,"TopNavRedesign":1002,"TopNav":1002,"ComposerNav":1123}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./politics","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/politics/georgia-state-legislature","parent":{"default":"/politics"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/politics","name":"Legislature","description":"News of the Georgia General Assembly, Georgia Governor and State Government from the AJC, Georgia's largest team covering the Legislature and issues that matter to taxpayers","_id":"/politics/georgia-state-legislature","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/politics","BottomNav":null,"TopNavRedesign":"/politics","TopNav":"/politics","ComposerNav":"/"},"site":{"site_url":"/politics/georgia-state-legislature/","section_comments_enabled":"Yes","site_description":"News of the Georgia General Assembly, Georgia Governor and State Government from the AJC, Georgia's largest team covering the Legislature and issues that matter to taxpayers","site_title":"Georgia Legislature News"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Legislature"},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Legislature","_id":"/politics/georgia-state-legislature","ancestors":{"TopNavRedesign":["/","/politics"],"TopNav":["/","/politics"]},"order":{"TopNavRedesign":2003,"TopNav":2003,"ComposerNav":1127}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./politics/georgia-state-legislature","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"}],"tags":[{"text":"politics.ajc"},{"text":"legislature"},{"text":"elections"},{"text":"elections-state"},{"text":"georgia news"},{"text":"georgia-news.ajc"},{"text":"ga-government.ajc"},{"text":"government and politics"}],"primary_section":{"path":"/politics","name":"Politics"}},"type":"story","last_updated_date":"2020-12-02T21:36:10.418Z","canonical_url":"/politics/former-marketing-exec-wins-runoff-for-atlanta-based-state-senate-seat/5LDDRBQMGFF67KGV6OAJ3WWDJA/","promo_items":{"basic":{"subtitle":"National Black Arts Festival changes, survives","width":1656,"caption":"Sonya Halpern will join the Georgia Senate after winning a runoff special election for an Atlanta-based seat.","type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/D5UWNTB5QQCEG6MSPFDETQJG4M.jpg","height":1536}},"_id":"5LDDRBQMGFF67KGV6OAJ3WWDJA"},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"GBEJ62QZHBFMBKD5CXC4TLZM5E","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1606906234628},"type":"text","content":"Teachers and students will have extra homework after the pandemic ends, as new findings show growth in math scores has fallen since last school year."},{"_id":"YPF5BYNUSBBINNTTCKI6OBIU3Y","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1606863417808},"type":"text","content":"Most Georgia students haven’t taken a state-standardized test since 2019, and most will not take another until the spring, if then."},{"_id":"FT724WTTCBCHRBUA2LMD3LLOIY","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1606863417809},"type":"text","content":"Without those scores on the Milestones tests, it’s unclear how big a toll COVID-19 has had on learning.

His work at the newspaper over the past decade has rooted out corruption and abuse, leading to changes in state law and federal investigations. \nEdwards previously worked at daily newspapers in Lynchburg, Va., and Augusta, Ga., and served time as an embedded reporter during the invasion of Iraq. He joined the AJC in 2010 as a local government reporter covering the state’s largest county, then joined the investigative team three years later.\nIn 2014, his reporting exposed how DeKalb County elected officials used their discretionary budgets for personal benefit, triggering an FBI investigation that resulted in criminal charges against a county commissioner and three other people. Edwards won Common Cause Georgia’s Democracy Award for that work, as well as the AJC’s first Emmy.\nIn 2016, he served on the team behind the AJC’s Doctors &amp; Sex Abuse project, a Pulitzer finalist, and recorded a podcast series on a predator doctor the following year. \nEdwards led the newspaper’s 2019 coverage of the Georgia House speaker’s use of legislative leave to delay criminal cases for clients of his private law practice, which won an Atlanta Press Club award for investigative reporting.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/johnny.r.edwards.9","affiliations":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","bio":"Johnny Edwards, a member of the AJC’s investigative team, covers the private sector and government regulation.","expertise":"9","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Johnny","twitter":"https://twitter.com/JohnEdwardsAJC","books":[],"podcasts":[{"name":"Predator M.D.","download_url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/breakdown/id992983540?mt=2","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/listen-season-the-ajc-breakdown-podcast/rtCTRJ8nFBzdyQMHbrTbMO/"}],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-7209","location":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","_id":"johnny-edwards","last_updated_date":"2020-10-06T14:16:38.755Z","byline":"Johnny Edwards","email":"johnny.edwards@ajc.com","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8"},{"image":{"version":"0.5.8","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/f9369d41-447e-44ed-8263-1bf273e84f9b.jpg"},"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links.","url":"ahart@ajc.com"}],"social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"ahart@ajc.com"}],"name":"Ariel Hart","description":"Ariel Hart is a reporter on health care issues.

His work at the newspaper over the past decade has rooted out corruption and abuse, leading to changes in state law and federal investigations. \nEdwards previously worked at daily newspapers in Lynchburg, Va., and Augusta, Ga., and served time as an embedded reporter during the invasion of Iraq. He joined the AJC in 2010 as a local government reporter covering the state’s largest county, then joined the investigative team three years later.\nIn 2014, his reporting exposed how DeKalb County elected officials used their discretionary budgets for personal benefit, triggering an FBI investigation that resulted in criminal charges against a county commissioner and three other people. Edwards won Common Cause Georgia’s Democracy Award for that work, as well as the AJC’s first Emmy.\nIn 2016, he served on the team behind the AJC’s Doctors &amp; Sex Abuse project, a Pulitzer finalist, and recorded a podcast series on a predator doctor the following year. \nEdwards led the newspaper’s 2019 coverage of the Georgia House speaker’s use of legislative leave to delay criminal cases for clients of his private law practice, which won an Atlanta Press Club award for investigative reporting.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/johnny.r.edwards.9","affiliations":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","bio":"Johnny Edwards, a member of the AJC’s investigative team, covers the private sector and government regulation.","expertise":"9","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Johnny","twitter":"https://twitter.com/JohnEdwardsAJC","books":[],"podcasts":[{"name":"Predator M.D.","download_url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/breakdown/id992983540?mt=2","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/listen-season-the-ajc-breakdown-podcast/rtCTRJ8nFBzdyQMHbrTbMO/"}],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-7209","location":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","_id":"johnny-edwards","last_updated_date":"2020-10-06T14:16:38.755Z","byline":"Johnny Edwards","email":"johnny.edwards@ajc.com","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8"}]},"headlines":{"basic":"Applying for a gun permit cost KSU student a night in jail"},"description":{"basic":"A Kennesaw State University student's ordeal reveals a hidden danger of applying for a concealed carry permit in Georgia."},"first_publish_date":"2020-11-24T16:19:43.102Z","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"path":"/news/investigations","parent":{"default":"/news"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/news","name":"Investigations","description":"Investigative journalism and deep reporting from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 2001. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I began covering transportation. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year to cover nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added on film and have had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I love tennis, pop culture and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an English bulldog named Goo Goo and an adopted daughter named Vega.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 2001. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I began covering transportation. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year to cover nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added on film and have had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I love tennis, pop culture and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an English bulldog named Goo Goo and an adopted daughter named Vega.
