<h1><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/m1_macs_truth_and_truthiness" title="Permanent link to ‘M1 Macs: Truth and Truthiness’">M1 Macs: Truth and Truthiness</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday,  2 December 2020</h6>

<p>We knew this to be true: Computers could run fast and hot, or slow and cool. For laptops in particular, the best you could hope for is a middle ground: fast enough and cool enough. But if you wanted a machine that ran really fast, it wasn’t going to run cool (and wasn’t going to last long on battery), and if you wanted a computer that ran cool (and lasted long on battery), it wasn’t going to be fast.</p>

<p>We knew this to be true because that was the way things were. But now, with the M1 Macs, it’s not. M1 Macs run very fast and do so while remaining very cool and lasting mind-bogglingly long on battery. It was a fundamental trade-off inherent to PC computing, and now we don’t have to make it.</p>

<p>We should have known better, because iPhones and iPads run fast and cool, but, they’re <em>different</em>. Right? They’re over <em>there</em>, running iOS, while Macs and other PCs are over <em>here</em>, running MacOS and Windows. But they’re not really different. They’re all just computers. And the best aspects of those computers — running fast and cool — obviously ought to be true for all computers.</p>

<p>M1 Macs embarrass all other PCs — all Intel-based Macs, including automobile-priced Mac Pros, and every single machine running Windows or Linux. Those machines are just standing around in their underwear now because the M1 stole all their pants. <em>Well, that just doesn’t happen,</em> your instincts tell you. One company, even a company like Apple, doesn’t just embarrass the entire rest of a highly-competitive longstanding industry. But just because something hasn’t happened — or hasn’t happened in a very long while — doesn’t mean it can’t happen. And in this case, it just happened.</p>

<p>Another long-held belief: emulating or translating apps compiled for a different architecture is necessarily going to be irritatingly slow and somewhat incompatible at best, and unusably slow and wildly incompatible as a general rule. But Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment?language=objc">Rosetta 2 translation layer</a> for running x86 software on Apple Silicon is a technical marvel. Remarkably compatible, and so fast that when combined with the pure speed of the M1 chips themselves, actually runs Intel Mac software as fast or faster than on most actual Intel Mac hardware. It’s not like Intel apps running in Rosetta run OK, and native Apple Silicon apps run well; it’s more like Intel apps in Rosetta run well and Apple Silicon apps run even better. Yes, of course you want apps compiled to run natively, but most users running most apps — including some professional apps — won’t notice.</p>

<p>Those of us who’ve been paying attention aren’t surprised that the M1 Macs have overturned these assumptions about what tradeoffs are unavoidable in terms of performance per watt. And it shouldn’t be a surprise that Apple had a remarkably good translation solution ready to go (despite the fact that yours truly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2005/06/see_you_intel">once again</a>, wrongly <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/on_apple_announcing_the_mac_arm_transition_at_wwdc#emulation">predicted otherwise</a>). It’s just a delight to see it finally come to fruition.</p>

<p>For the industry as a whole, though, the M1 Macs have dropped as a bit of a shock. One reason for this, I think, is that Apple’s silicon prowess in iOS devices has been a slow boil. iPhones and iPads are better computers — faster and more efficient — than their Android competitors. But it’s been an annual incremental game. And it’s hard to tell what’s attributable to iOS’s software efficiency vs. Android and what’s attributable to Apple’s silicon prowess vs. Qualcomm and Samsung and whoever else is making chips for Android devices.</p>

<p>M1 Macs completely upend what we can and should expect from PCs. It’s a breakthrough along the lines of the iPhone itself in 2007.</p>

<p>The adage is, “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” Emphasis on <em>probably</em> — the M1 Macs are an exception. They really are that good. But, like the iPhone in 2007, there are people who refuse to believe it.</p>

<p>Exhibit A: Patrick Moorhead, whose review for Forbes — “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2020/11/21/apple-macbook-pro-13-m1-reviewwhy-you-might-want-to-pass/">Apple MacBook Pro 13” M1 Review — Why You Might Want to Pass</a>” — <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/201124/p3#a201124p3">took off</a> when published last week. </p>

<p>Moorhead’s review bears little relation to the reality of the M1 Macs, but plays right into expectations of the status quo. <em>ARM chips are efficient and Apple’s ARM chips are the best, but none of them are a threat to Intel and AMD’s x86 chips for high-end performance. Emulation is slow and buggy and it will take years for a lot of important software to be updated to run natively.</em> None of that’s true in the M1 Macs’ case, but that’s the premise of Moorhead’s article.</p>

<p>And some folks bought it — some out of <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyRomm/status/1331247834298019844">reasonable skepticism</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/thurrott/status/1330866325556768770">some out of stupidity</a>.</p>

<p>Moorhead opens thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve read the first batch of Apple MacBook Pro 13″ M1 reviews
and you’d be hard to find anything negative about the new
laptop. At the worst, there were some complaints about the iOS
app experience, but on the whole, early reviews, described the
new MacBook Pro 13″ essentially as God’s gift to the notebook
wanting masses.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, there were some very positive things about the
new laptop. The new M1 processor is impressive, but far from
perfect — it has many warts, that nearly nobody is discussing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not one of these purported “warts” with the M1 is ever mentioned. Whatever real problems Moorhead ran into (and some were indeed real), they’re all related to software issues. Either MacOS 11 Big Sur itself, or Rosetta, or apps he’s trying to use that have compatibility issues with MacOS 11 or Rosetta or both. But: software. Those issues are real, and the fact that M1 Macs require MacOS 11 Big Sur is the single biggest reason why some Mac users can’t or at least shouldn’t buy one just yet. Even if there were no architecture transition, in normal years it’s completely reasonable for many users to delay upgrading to major new releases of MacOS. I didn’t upgrade my old MacBook Pro to MacOS 10.15 Catalina until August of this year.</p>

<p>Here’s a terrific piece by Peter Steinberger — “<a href="https://steipete.com/posts/apple-silicon-m1-a-developer-perspective/">Apple Silicon M1: A Developer’s Perspective</a>” — that goes into great detail about how amazing the M1 is but also how many essential developer tools aren’t compatible or fully compatible with MacOS 11 on Apple Silicon yet. <a href="https://steipete.com/posts/apple-silicon-m1-a-developer-perspective/">Steinberger’s conclusion</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new M1 MacBooks are fast, beautiful and silent and the hype is
absolutely justified. There’s still a lot to do on the
software-front to catch up, and the bugs around older iOS
Simulators are especially problematic.</p>

<p>All of that can be fixed in software and the whole industry is
currently working on making the experience better, so by next
year, when Apple updates the 16-inch MacBook Pro and releases the
next generation of their M chip line, it should be absolutely
possible to use a M1 Mac as main dev machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steinberger’s is a scrupulously fair conclusion. Perversely, developers, who by nature of their profession best understand exactly what an architecture transition like this entails, might be among the few professions who can’t yet move their primary computing to an Apple Silicon device by nature of the software tools they depend upon. (Some developers <em>can</em> move now, and — because Xcode running on the M1 compiles code so much faster than any Intel MacBook — are rejoicing.)</p>

<p>Moorhead, on the other hand, claims, right up front, that it’s the M1 that has “warts”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the new MacBook Pro 13” M1 will likely be fine for
users who use 100% Apple software, stay primarily in Safari and
don’t need to connect it to a bunch of peripherals, and have a
lot of money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is Chrome “100 percent Apple software”? Because Chrome runs better on the M1 than it does on any other Mac. Yes, Safari is faster and more energy efficient than Chrome, but Safari is faster than Chrome on Intel-based Macs as well. “And have a lot of money” — I have no idea what that even means other than being able to buy a Mac in the first place, which seems to me a given. But while the entry price for a MacBook Air remains $999, the effective usefulness of the new M1 $999 MacBook Air is <em>far</em> higher than that of the $999 Intel-based MacBook Air it replaced. The M1 is good news even for Mac users on a smaller budget.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wanted to provide some balance to those early reviews and
discuss who I believe <em>shouldn’t</em> consider the new MacBook Pro 13”
M1. I know that may sound <em>negative</em>, but I call it <em>balance</em>.
I’ve used my unit for nearly five days and here is my assessment
of whom I think should avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stephen Colbert famously quipped at the 2006 White House Correspondants Dinner that “<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert">reality has a well-known liberal bias.</a>” Well, the reality of the M1 has an Apple bias. There is no “<em>Well, here’s the downside</em>” with regard to the state of Apple Silicon versus the entire rest of the industry. Yes, the M1 is a consumer chip with consumer limits — two USB ports, a maximum of 16 GB of RAM — but that’s the nature of <em>these</em> Apple Silicon Mac models, not all Apple Silicon Mac models to come.</p>

<p>There is no balance, if by balance, you’re looking for a story that says any PC hardware, ARM or x86, is competitive in any way with the M1 Macs for low-energy computing. I’m reminded of another quote, from then-CEO Ed Colligan of then-company Palm in November 2006, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2006/11/colligan_head_stuck">a few months ahead of the iPhone’s introduction</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Responding to questions from New York Times correspondent John
Markoff at a Churchill Club breakfast gathering Thursday morning,
Colligan laughed off the idea that any company — including the
wildly popular Apple Computer — could easily win customers in the
finicky smart-phone sector.</p>

<p>“We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how
to make a decent phone,” he said. “PC guys are not going to just
figure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Patrick Moorhead’s M1 Mac review can be paraphrased as “<em>Intel and AMD have learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make decent PC chips. Apple hasn’t just magically figured this out. They’re not going to just walk in.</em>”</p>

<p>The difference is, Colligan at least hadn’t seen the iPhone yet. Moorhead has an M1 MacBook Pro in his hands. He either should know better, or does know better and wrote this grossly misleading tripe anyway, knowing there was an Apple-skeptical audience willing to lap it up.</p>

<p>We’ve seen this before. In 2013, Apple announced the iPhone 5S with the A7 chip, the first 64-bit mobile CPU — years ahead of industry expectations. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/09/12/samsung-64">Here’s what Moorhead said then</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Adding 64-bit processor capabilities adds nothing to the user
experience today, as it would requires over four gigabytes of
memory,” Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy, and a
former executive at AMD, told AllThingsD. “Most phones today only
have one to two gigabytes of memory, and it will be years before
the norm is four.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/7335/the-iphone-5s-review/4">That did not pan out well for Moorhead</a>.</p>

<p>In 2015, Apple shipped the first iPad Pro, with the A9X chip. 
Aaron Souppouris wrote a piece for Engadget headlined “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-14-ipad-pro-a9x-chip.html">The iPad Pro’s Chip Is Not a Big Deal</a>”. You will never guess who Souppouris’s expert source was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what of the benchmark tests that show the iPad Pro
outperforming Intel’s Core M processor, and even coming close to
Intel’s MacBook Pro range? Don’t believe them. Patrick Moorhead, a
highly respected analyst with a strong background in chips, urges
caution, especially when it comes to comparing GeekBench numbers,
as many have. “GeekBench is a synthetic, mobile benchmark,”
Moorhead tells Engadget. “The benchmark code is more like mobile
application code than it is desktop code.” Using GeekBench to test
A9X versus Intel chips is “like comparing apples and oranges or an
SUV with a sedan on the straight-away,” he explains. […]</p>

<p>Apple doesn’t have such a large legacy to support — it only moved
to Intel chips nine years ago — but there would be no perceivable
benefit to switching an existing x86 platform to ARM. “I do not
believe ARM-based chips will be powering Macs in the next few
years,” said Moorhead. “I do believe Apple will attempt to scale
up the iPad Pro even further, which could potentially eat into
Macbook [<em>sic</em>] sales.” […]</p>

<p>According to Moorhead, Intel came close to putting one of its
chips inside the iPad Pro. “[The iPad Pro] business is open to
both Apple’s own ARM-based AX chips and Intel,” he explained,
“Intel is fighting hard to get that business and I believe almost
had [the iPad Pro contract] with the new Skylake-based Core M had
it been available earlier.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So on the M1 Mac rave-review side, we have <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/201117/p18#a201117p18">every major professional reviewer</a>, along with <a href="https://www.singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">dozens and dozens of ordinary M1 Mac purchasers</a> out in the real world, doing real things, who just can’t believe what the M1 is capable of.</p>

<p>And on the other side, we have Patrick Moorhead, the guy who said Apple’s 64-bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S was no big deal; that we shouldn’t have believed the benchmarks showing the original iPad Pro pantsing Intel’s chips five years ago; and that not only was Apple unlikely to switch the Mac away from Intel, but that Intel, in fact, was <em>this close</em> to getting its chips into the iPad Pro.</p>

<p>One of these sides deserves more skepticism than the other.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://nadim.computer/posts/2020-11-26-macbookm1.html">Here’s an M1 MacBook Pro review I just loved, from Nadim Kobeissi</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the risk of making this a very boring review, all I have to say
is basically that all of the above is so far holding as true. This
computer is nuts. Compiling tons of things in the background
doesn’t slow down Safari web browsing, somehow. I haven’t had to
plug it in once since I fully charged it up two days ago.
Performance is so quiet and cool that I feel like my terminal
compiling a bunch of things is actually an SSH into a much
stronger workstation located somewhere else. I actually discovered
that I’ve had an instinct of measuring my MacBook’s CPU usage by
feeling the heat on the strip of aluminum right above the Touch
Bar, and I can’t even do that anymore now. Because even if the M1
MacBook Pro has been running at 100% on all cores for ten straight
minutes, you’ll barely feel it getting warm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kobeissi is both technically scrupulous (and clearly knowledgeable) but also doesn’t hide his genuine enthusiasm. The M1 <em>is</em> exciting! Even I am using exclamation marks. And what a keen point Kobeissi makes about subconsciously equating a laptop working hard with physical manifestations — as heat you can feel and fan noise you can hear. It is, for now, utterly uncanny that when an M1 MacBook exerts itself computationally it neither gets warm nor makes any noise. Soon though, that will seem utterly normal, and it’ll be every other laptop in the world, the ones that do get hot and do make noise (or never go fast in the first place) that will seem wrong and weird.</p>

<p>Kobeissi also calls out this particular slide from Apple’s M1 keynote:</p>

<p><a href="/misc/2020/12/m1-performance-vs-power-bezos-chart.png" class="noborder">
<img src="/misc/2020/12/m1-performance-vs-power-bezos-chart.png" alt="Apple’s “M1 Performance vs. Power” Bezos chart." width="450" /></a></p>

<p>He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This graph is completely worthless. Honestly. Nobody knows to this
day what Apple meant by “Latest PC laptop chip”, and both axes
aren’t even numbered. It’s stupid that Apple still pulls this sort
of thing off, and it immediately makes you question just how good
the M1 is really supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get it. It’s a pure <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/481863414180896769">Bezos chart</a>. With no scale on either axis and a comparison against an unnamed competitor, there’s no way to verify that it’s true.</p>

<p>But I also get why Apple presented it this way, because while it’s not true in any scientific sense, per se, it is very much an accurate illustration of the M1 vs. its competition overall. Is this a graph of exporting video? Or compiling code? Or running complex web applications in a browser? Or playing a game? <em>Yes</em>. That’s what this graph is trying to say: yes to all of it. The M1 is up <em>here</em>, running fast and cool, and all the competing chips from Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Samsung, and whoever else are down <em>there</em>, running hot or running slow, looking around for their recently stolen pants.</p>

<p>To borrow another Colbert-ism, sometimes an assertion of <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-playlists/kw3fj0/the-opposition-with-jordan-klepper-welcome-to-the-opposition-w--jordan-klepper/63ite2">truthiness</a> is actually true. <a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘M1 Macs: Truth and Truthiness’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/m1_macs_truth_and_truthiness">★</a></p>

  <p>Alexander Graf was the first to successfully run an ARM Windows

it’s an unofficial workaround.</p>

<p>Impressively, the Martin’s M1 Mac mini benchmarked much higher

<blockquote>
  <p>Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff didn’t mince words on
his latest purchase. “This is a match made in heaven. Together,
Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software
and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital,
work-from-anywhere world,” Benioff said in a statement.</p>

<p>Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield was no less effusive than his future
boss. “As software plays a more and more critical role in the
performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced
complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a
greater degree of alignment and organizational agility.
Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in
the history of software, and I can’t wait to get going,”
Butterfield said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/25/slack-salesforce">I cracked wise</a> about Salesforce offering user experience and design expertise to Slack when rumors of this deal first leaked, but let me now take the devil’s advocate position, and argue for why this could be a great outcome for Slack.</p>

<p>First, my take presupposes that the point of Slack is to be a genuinely good service and experience. That Slack is to Microsoft Teams what the Mac is to Windows, or iOS is to Android. To succeed by appealing to people who care about quality. Slack, as a public company, has been under immense pressure to do whatever it takes to make its stock price go up in the face of competition from Microsoft’s Teams, which Microsoft is just giving away to its customers paying for 365 Office or whatever they call the thing companies want to pay Microsoft for.</p>

<p>Apple, 20 years ago, successfully forged a way to align its shareholder interests with its customer interests. Make great computers, great software, great new products and services like the iPod and iTunes Store. Slack, it seems to me, has been pulled apart. What they ought to be entirely focused on is making Slack great in Slack-like ways. Perhaps Salesforce sees that Slack gives them an offering competitive to Teams, and if they just let Slack be Slack, their offering will be better — be designed for users, better integrated for developers. And there’s some history for that: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku-for-212-million-in-cash/">Salesforce acquired Heroku</a> almost 10 years ago — and seemingly has let Heroku be Heroku since.</p>

<p>Do that with Slack and I could see this working out great for Slack users.</p>

<p>Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang, reporting for Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Samsung Electronics Co Ltd may discontinue its premium Galaxy Note
phone next year, sources with knowledge of the matter said, a move
that would reflect the sharp drop in demand for high-end
smartphones due to the coronavirus pandemic. […]</p>

<p>At present, the South Korean tech giant does not have plans to
develop a new version of the Galaxy Note for 2021, three sources
said, declining to be identified as the plans were not public.
Instead, the Galaxy S series’ top model, the S21, will have a
stylus and the next version of Samsung’s foldable phone will be
compatible with a stylus, which will be sold separately, one of
the sources said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like it has nothing to do with demand for high-end phones in general, and everything to do with the Note’s <em>raison d’être</em> — integrated stylus support — being rolled out across Samsung’s entire high-end lineup. Samsung sells high-end regular phones and high-end gimmick phones. The gimmick used to be the stylus, <a href="https://twitter.com/joannastern/status/1333858621818630147">now it’s folding</a>.</p>

<dd>
<p>Richard Hofstadter, in his seminal 1964 essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>American politics has often been an arena for angry minds. In
recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme
right-wingers, who have now demonstrated in the Goldwater movement
how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and
passions of a small minority. But behind this I believe there is a
style of mind that is far from new and that is not necessarily
right-wing. I call it the paranoid style simply because no other
word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration,
suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind. In
using the expression “paranoid style” I am not speaking in a
clinical sense, but borrowing a clinical term for other purposes.
I have neither the competence nor the desire to classify any
figures of the past or present as certifiable lunatics. In fact,
the idea of the paranoid style as a force in politics would have
little contemporary relevance or historical value if it were
applied only to men with profoundly disturbed minds. It is the use
of paranoid modes of expression by more or less normal people that
makes the phenomenon significant. […]</p>

<p>Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good
and absolute evil, what is necessary is not compromise but the
will to fight things out to a finish. Since the enemy is thought
of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable, he must be
totally eliminated — if not from the world, at least from the
theatre of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention.
This demand for total triumph leads to the formulation of
hopelessly unrealistic goals, and since these goals are not even
remotely attainable, failure constantly heightens the paranoid’s
sense of frustration. Even partial success leaves him with the
same feeling of powerlessness with which he began, and this in
turn only strengthens his awareness of the vast and terrifying
quality of the enemy he opposes.</p>

<p>I, for one, take solace in knowing we’re not seeing something new.</p>

<p>Chris Forsythe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Growl is being retired after surviving for 17 years. With the
announcement of Apple’s new hardware platform, a general shift of
developers to Apple’s notification system, and a lack of obvious
ways to improve Growl beyond what it is and has been, we’re
announcing the retirement of Growl as of today.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming. Growl is the project I worked on for
the longest period of my open source career. However at WWDC in
2012 everyone on the team saw the writing on the wall. This was my
only WWDC. This is the WWDC where Notification Center was
announced. Ironically Growl was called Global Notifications
Center, before I renamed it to Growl because I thought the name
was too geeky. There’s even a sourceforge project for Global
Notifications Center still out there if you want to go find it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a great open source project Growl was. It proved itself as a feature that should have been built into MacOS — and then it was. Growl arguably defined “notifications” as we know them, not just on Mac, but iOS and Android as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/boredzo/status/1332940019170828292">Peter Hosey</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing that working on Growl helped shape in me: A militant
respect for people’s attention as well as what they do and do not
want their tools to do.</p>

<p>Long after the official end of @GrowlMac, I will always have that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheers to that. Growl <em>respected</em> the user — it served the notify<em>ee</em>, not the notifi<em>er</em>, and that made all the difference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has
always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a
constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural
life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that “my
ignorance is just as good as your knowledge”.</p>

<p>Good column from David Brooks over the weekend:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For those awash in anxiety and alienation, who feel that
everything is spinning out of control, conspiracy theories are
extremely effective emotional tools. For those in low status
groups, they provide a sense of superiority: <em>I possess important
information most people do not have</em>. For those who feel
powerless, they provide agency: <em>I have the power to reject
“experts” and expose hidden cabals</em>. As Cass Sunstein of Harvard
Law School points out, they provide liberation: <em>If I imagine my
foes are completely malevolent, then I can use any tactic I want</em>.</p>

<p>Under Trump, the Republican identity is defined not by a set of
policy beliefs but by a paranoid mind-set. […]</p>

<p>What to do? You can’t argue people out of paranoia. If you try to
point out factual errors, you only entrench false belief. The
only solution is to reduce the distrust and anxiety that is the
seedbed of this thinking. That can only be done first by contact,
reducing the social chasm between the members of the epistemic
regime and those who feel so alienated from it. And second, it
can be done by policy, by making life more secure for those
without a college degree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“You can’t argue people out of paranoia” nails the deep dark conundrum we face. A good example, from his NYT op-ed page colleague Maureen Dowd, who for years now has turned over her Thanksgiving column to her Republican brother, a supposed conservative. This tradition of Dowd’s drives many readers nuts, but I have always enjoyed — well, no, not <em>enjoyed</em>, but <em>appreciated</em> — it for the insight into how a large group I’m not a part of, and generally disagree with, thinks. This year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/26/opinion/thanksgiving-dowd-2020.html">Kevin Dowd revealed himself to be well on his way to Kookville</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Democrats remain mystified by the loyalty of Trump’s base. It
is rock solid because half the country was tired of being
patronized and lied to and worse, taken for granted. Trump was
unique because he was only interested in results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes, Trump’s base remains united behind him because they’re … <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/">tired of being lied to</a>. That’s it. It’s certainly not that they’re tired of being told truths they do not want to hear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A word of caution to Fox News: Your not-so-subtle shift leftward
is a mistake. You are one of a kind. Watching the quick abdication
of Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum following the election (joining
an already hostile Chris Wallace) was like finding out my wife was
cheating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This treachery that Kevin Dowd equates to his wife cheating on him was acknowledging that Joe Biden soundly beat Donald Trump in the election. That’s not a leftward shift. It’s a statement of fact. A truth, inconvenient or not.</p>

  <p>Nick Swinmurn started Zappos in 1999, raised $500,000 in funding from Tony &amp; Alfred. It was originally called Shoesite.com Tony later became CEO in 2000. Swinmurn left the company, in 2006. Amazon bought Zappos for $1.2 billion in 2009.</p>

<p>“Shoesite.com” is adorable. The name alone captures the ethos of that late ’90s “dot com” era. Of course the original name was just “shoesite.com”. And of course it <a href="http://shoesite.com/">still redirects</a> to Zappos.</p>

<p>I wrote about LinkExchange for Forbes, even though I never met Tony or Alfred till much later in life. My startup was housed in the same office as LinkExchange in SOMA through some strange twist of fate. I later got to know Tony socially through non-tech friends. Quiet, kind, quirky, but always open to the impossible.</p>

<p>With Tony’s passing, I feel something special has ended. I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe a certain innocent aspect of the early possibilities of the Internet. Maybe I feel the contrast of those days to a now that is more mercenary, less friendly, and more polarized. Whatever, without knowing Tony as well as I should, I mourn him deeply.</p>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Nice high-level overview from Apple’s developer documentation team. One pedantic note worth emphasizing (I made this mistake in my M1 MacBook Pro review) — Rosetta is translation, not emulation, and technically that’s a big deal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To the user, Rosetta is mostly transparent. If an executable
contains only Intel instructions, macOS automatically launches
Rosetta and begins the translation process. When translation
finishes, the system launches the translated executable in place
of the original. However, the translation process takes time, so
users might perceive that translated apps launch or run more
slowly at times.</p>

<p>The system prefers to execute an app’s <code>arm64</code> instructions on
Apple silicon. If a binary includes both <code>arm64</code> and <code>x86_64</code>
instructions, the user can tell the system to launch the app using
Rosetta translation from the app’s Get Info window in the Finder.
For example, a user might enable Rosetta translation to allow the
app to run older plug-ins that don’t yet support the <code>arm64</code>
architecture.</p>

  <p>After years of denying allegations of lax financial oversight, the National Rifle Association has made a stunning declaration in a new tax filing: Current and former executives used the nonprofit group’s money for personal benefit and enrichment.</p>

<p>The NRA said in the filing that it continues to review the alleged abuse of funds, as the tax-exempt organization curtails services and runs up multimillion-dollar legal bills. The assertion of impropriety comes four months after the attorney general of New York state filed a lawsuit accusing NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and other top officials of using NRA funds for decades to provide inflated salaries and expense accounts.</p>

<p>The tax return, which The Washington Post obtained from the organization, says the NRA “became aware during 2019 of a significant diversion of its assets.” The 2019 filing states that LaPierre and five former officials received “excess benefits,” a term the IRS uses when officials have enriched themselves at the expense of a nonprofit entity.</p>

<p>The Republican Party no longer stands for conservatives; it stands for corruption and incompetence. The NRA is squarely on the corrupt side.

is accused of offering 200 iPads to the Santa County Sheriff’s
office in exchange for concealed carry permits for four Apple

<p>Moyer’s attorney says that he did nothing wrong, and notably Apple
is standing behind its executive. “We expect all of our employees

in a statement. “After learning of the allegations, we conducted a
thorough internal investigation and found no wrongdoing.”</p>

<p>Kevin Roose, Mike Isaac, and Sheera Frenkel, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typically, N.E.Q. scores play a minor role in determining what
appears on users’ feeds. But several days after the election, Mr.
Zuckerberg agreed to increase the weight that Facebook’s algorithm
gave to N.E.Q. scores to make sure authoritative news appeared
more prominently, said three people with knowledge of the
decision, who were not authorized to discuss internal
deliberations.</p>

<p>The change was part of the “break glass” plans Facebook had spent
months developing for the aftermath of a contested election. It
resulted in a spike in visibility for big, mainstream publishers
like CNN, The New York Times and NPR, while posts from highly
engaged hyperpartisan pages, such as Breitbart and Occupy
Democrats, became less visible, the employees said.</p>

<p>It was a vision of what a calmer, less divisive Facebook might
look like. Some employees argued the change should become
permanent, even if it was unclear how that might affect the amount
of time people spent on Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facebook shouldn’t need to inject emergency doses of truth and reality into their newsfeed. It should be the norm, full stop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the past several months, as Facebook has come under more
scrutiny for its role in amplifying false and divisive
information, its employees have clashed over the company’s future.
On one side are idealists, including many rank-and-file workers
and some executives, who want to do more to limit misinformation
and polarizing content. On the other side are pragmatists who fear
those measures could hurt Facebook’s growth, or provoke a
political backlash that leads to painful regulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good report from the Times, but calling the one side “idealists” and the other “pragmatists” is a disservice to both sides. Those who want to limit misinformation and polarizing content are good, honest people. There’s nothing “idealistic” about that. And the other side, who are on the side of pushing misinformation and polarizing content, despite knowing how harmful it is, are not “pragmatists”.</p>

<p><em>Sociopath</em> is the word. <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/sociopath-0">The definition</a> fits to a T: <em>a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience</em>. There’s no better word to describe Facebook’s leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company had surveyed users about whether certain posts they
had seen were “good for the world” or “bad for the world.” They
found that high-reach posts — posts seen by many users — were
more likely to be considered “bad for the world,” a finding that
some employees said alarmed them.</p>

<p>So the team trained a machine-learning algorithm to predict posts
that users would consider “bad for the world” and demote them in
news feeds. In early tests, the new algorithm successfully reduced
the visibility of objectionable content. But it also lowered the
number of times users opened Facebook, an internal metric known as
“sessions” that executives monitor closely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facebook knowingly pushes polarizing misinformation, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/26/facebook-algorithm-conservative-liberal-extremes/">particularly to conservatives</a>, because it’s addictive and despite knowing exactly what they’re doing and why it’s wrong and that it’s making the world worse.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg is a sociopath. A real-life Bond villain.</p>

<p>Ben Thompson has a good column at Stratechery on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/23/klein-yglesias-vox">Matt Yglesias and Ezra Klein departing Vox</a> in very different, but very on-personal-brand ways. </p>

<p>Thompson ties in the Vox talent exodus with <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/buzzfeed-to-acquire-huffpost_n_5fb6b4c9c5b6f00bd84e74b3">BuzzFeed’s acquisition last week of HuffPost</a>, which leads him to the following comment regarding BuzzFeed chief <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/11/19/21578476/buzzfeed-huffpost-new-york-times-jonah-peretti-interview-podcast">Jonah Peretti’s curious claim, in an interview with Peter Kafka at Recode</a> (a Vox sub-site!), that the Times’s paid-subscriber-focused strategy somehow puts them at odds with their longstanding mission to serve as the paper of record:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time, it is worth noting that the New York Times
has, contrary to Peretti’s implication, never been a newspaper
for the masses. Sure, its subscription model is by default
exclusionary, but only being available in printed form, mostly
in New York, was far more exclusionary. The point about
subscriptions driving a particular point of view is a valid one,
but then again, it is not as if BuzzFeed has been shy about its
political preferences either. The reality is that the
implication of the Internet is that ideas are in abundance, and
people will seek out what they already agree with, as opposed to
accepting what is delivered to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paid-subscriber focus or no, the New York Times today is far more accessible to far more people, free of charge, than it ever could have been in the pre-web era. The quality of the work the Times publishes will continue, more than ever, to be the foundation upon which its reputation stands. There was a time not so long ago when upstarts, like Peretti, saw the Times as old and slow. Not any more. Well, <em>old</em>, yes, but not slow. Joining forces with HuffPost feels like the stodgy media move of the month.</p>

<p>This follows fellow Vox founder Matt Yglesias, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/welcome-to-slow-boring">who left to start his own subscriber-based weblog, Slow Boring</a>, on Substack 10 days ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jim Bankoff, the Vox Media chief executive, said the company was
now in a position to withstand the loss of key employees. “All the
Vox Media brands are well past the point where they are about

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Advertising that respects privacy is not only possible, it was the
standard until the growth of the Internet.</em> Some companies that
would prefer ATT is never implemented have said that this policy
uniquely burdens small businesses by restricting advertising
options, but in fact, the current data arms race primarily
benefits big businesses with big data sets. Privacy-focused ad
networks were the universal standard in advertising before the
practice of unfettered data collection began over the last decade
or so. Our hope is that increasing user demands for privacy and
security, as well as changes like ATT, will make these
privacy-forward advertising standards robust once more. […]</p>

<p>By contrast, Facebook and others have a very different approach to
targeting. Not only do they allow the grouping of users into
smaller segments, they use detailed data about online browsing
activity to target ads. Facebook executives have made clear their
intent is to collect as much data as possible across both first
and third party products to develop and monetize detailed profiles
of their users, and this disregard for user privacy continues to
expand to include more of their products.</p>

<p>Zack Whittaker, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a Go SMS Pro user sends a photo, video or other file to
someone who doesn’t have the app installed, the app uploads the
file to its servers, and lets the user share a web address by
text message so the recipient can see the file without
installing the app. But the researchers found that these web
addresses were sequential. In fact, any time a file was shared — even between app users — a web address would be generated
regardless. That meant anyone who knew about the predictable web
address could have cycled through millions of different web
addresses to users’ files.</p>

<p>Go SMS Pro has more than 100 million installs, according to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jb.gosms">its
listing in Google
Play</a>.</p>

<p>TechCrunch verified the researcher’s findings. In viewing just a
few dozen links, we found a person’s phone number, a screenshot of
a bank transfer, an order confirmation including someone’s home
address, an arrest record, and far more explicit photos than we
were expecting, to be quite honest.</p>

Undersheriff Rick Sung, 48, and Capt. James Jensen, 43, who are
accused of requesting bribes for concealed firearms licenses, also
known as CCW licenses. Insurance broker Harpreet Chadha, 49, and
Apple’s Chief Security Officer Thomas Moyer, 50, are accused of
offering bribes to receive the permits, District Attorney Jeff
Rosen said during a press conference on Monday morning.</p>

<p>The two-year investigation by the district attorney’s office found
that Sung, who was allegedly aided by Jensen in one instance, held
up the distribution of CCW licenses and refused to release them
until the applicants gave something of value. […]</p>

<p>Sung and Jensen allegedly held up four gun licenses from Apple
employees and extracted from Moyer a promise that Apple would
donate iPads to the sheriff’s office. A donation of 200 iPads
worth nearly $70,000 was ended at the last minute after Aug. 2,

<p>The staffers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the

was one of many U.S. companies that oppose the bill as it’s
written. They declined to disclose details on the specific
provisions Apple was trying to knock down or change because they
feared providing that knowledge would identify them to Apple. But
they both characterized Apple’s effort as an attempt to water down
the bill.</p>

many of us into computing. And the Mac is what brought many of us
to Apple. And the Mac remains the tool that we all use to do our

else could or couldn’t do. Every company has an agenda. The
software company wishes the hardware companies would do this. The
hardware companies wish the OS company would do this, but they
have competing agendas. And that’s not the case here. We had one
agenda.”</p>

  <p>The U.S. military is buying the granular movement data of people
around the world, harvested from innocuous-seeming apps,
Motherboard has learned. The most popular app among a group
Motherboard analyzed connected to this sort of data sale is a
Muslim prayer and Quran app that has more than 98 million
downloads worldwide. Others include a Muslim dating app, a popular
Craigslist app, an app for following storms, and a “level” app
that can be used to help, for example, install shelves in a
bedroom.</p>

<p>Through public records, interviews with developers, and technical
analysis, Motherboard uncovered two separate, parallel data
streams that the U.S. military uses, or has used, to obtain
location data. One relies on a company called Babel Street, which
creates a product called Locate X. U.S. Special Operations Command
(USSOCOM), a branch of the military tasked with counterterrorism,
counterinsurgency, and special reconnaissance, bought access to
Locate X to assist on overseas special forces operations. The
other stream is through a company called X-Mode, which obtains
location data directly from apps, then sells that data to
contractors, and by extension, the military.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developers: Read this thread and please, please push back on
growth hackers telling you to put random ass libraries in
your apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a whole seedy industry of location/data harvesting companies who pay the developers of popular (or even just semi-popular — anything with users) apps to include their frameworks in their applications. This is especially true for apps that ask for location permissions for legitimate purposes — things like weather or dating apps. If you, the user, grant the app location access, you’re granting it to all the frameworks embedded in the app too. That’s how this company X-Mode collects, packages, and sells the location data for untold millions of users who’ve never heard of X-Mode. They’re like privacy permission parasites.</p>

<p>X-Mode, specifically, isn’t the scandal — the scandal is the whole industry, and the widespread practice of apps just embedding them for the money without looking at what they do, or disclosing these “partnerships” to users.</p>

<p>Bare Bones Software, back on October 15:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BBEdit 13.5 now runs natively on Apple Silicon, and introduces a
Markdown Cheat Sheet, internal performance improvements, support
for “rescuing” untitled documents, and numerous additions and
refinements designed to improve efficiency. In all, version 13.5
includes more than a hundred new features, refinements to existing
features, and fixes to reported issues. At present, only the
BBEdit 13.5 application available directly from Bare Bones
Software is Universal, while all applications in the Mac App Store
currently remain Intel-only.</p>

<p>“Over the last 30 years, millions of people have turned to BBEdit
to get the job done when the going gets tough,” said Rich Siegel,
founder and CEO of Bare Bones Software, Inc. “That’s why we make
sure BBEdit is first in place on day one: first on PowerPC, first
on Mac OS X, first on Intel, first on the Mac App Store, and now
first on Apple silicon. You can use BBEdit to make quick notes,
write code, and do all the basics, but you can also use BBEdit to
sift, process, and transform multi-gigabyte files, crunch through
hundreds of thousands of files, and transform text in a truly
dizzying variety of ways.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I recall correctly, BBEdit’s initial PowerPC update was a plug-in that ran inside the 68K app, just to speed up text transformations. It would have been surprising if BBEdit had not been first out of the gate to support Apple Silicon.</p>

<p>Here’s a BBEdit story. I was several hundred words into <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro">my iPhone 12 review</a> last month, went to get another cup of coffee, came back, and boom, the MacBook Pro I was using had kernel panicked. This machine hadn’t kernel panicked in <em>years</em>. It hasn’t kernel panicked again since. Murphy’s Law was trying to screw me.</p>

<p>I hadn’t saved what I’d written yet. Now, it was only a few hundred words, but they were an important few hundred words, the ones that got me started. The words that got the wheels turning, that got momentum going.</p>

<p>Rebooted. Took a sip of coffee. Logged in.</p>

<p>Looked at BBEdit. There it was. Right where I left off.</p>

<p>That’s BBEdit.</p>

<p>Jim Salter, writing for Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google presents Chrome for <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">download</a> as either an x86_64 package
or an M1 native option — which comes across as a little odd,
since the M1 native version is actually a universal binary, which
works on either M1 or traditional Intel Macs. Presumably, Google
is pushing separate downloads due to the much smaller file size
necessary for the x86_64-only package — the universal binary
contains both x86_64 and ARM applications, and weighs in at 165MiB
to the Intel-only package’s 96MiB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Intel binary of Chrome running through Rosetta on M1 Macs wasn’t slow, but the native version is, unsurprisingly, a lot faster. Salter ran a bunch of benchmarks, though, and Safari is still faster than native Chrome on MacOS 11 Big Sur on M1 Macs.</p>

<p>Google is definitely doing this wrong, asking users to navigate <a href="/misc/2020/11/chrome-arch-choice.png">this</a> before downloading. Chrome is supposedly for everyone, not just nerds. Plus, if you already have the Intel-only build installed on an M1 Mac, Chrome’s weird auto-update feature isn’t updating to a native Apple Silicon build. Google has trained Chrome users for years not to do anything, to just trust that Chrome will automatically keep itself up to date, but typical users with the Intel build installed are going to be running at half speed through Rosetta.</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1142017">Here’s a detailed discussion on the Chromium developer forum</a> discussing the pros and cons of simply shipping a universal binary. The basic gist is that Chrome is so large, doubling the compiled binary footprint for a universal build was deemed problematic for all users. Why make the majority of Mac users still on Intel-based Macs download a version twice as large? I’d say the problem is that Chrome is too bloated. They should ship a universal binary to everyone and get to work slimming Chrome’s footprint. Maybe some work on that would help Chrome catch up to Safari performance-wise.</p>

<p>Pixelmator:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Pixelmator Pro editing engine is powered by high-performance
Metal code, so we can take advantage of the unified memory
architecture of the M1 chip to bring you much speedier and much
more responsive image editing. Machine learning tasks like ML
Super Resolution are now up to a staggering 15 times faster on the
new Macs. And, as a Universal app, Pixelmator Pro 2.0 runs
natively on both M1 and Intel-based devices, so we’re completely
ready for the new era of Mac.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can vouch for that — I was using Pixelmator Pro 1.8 through Rosetta when I initially started testing the M1 MacBook Pro last week. It worked fine, and felt comparable to running it on an Intel Mac. But ML Super Resolution — <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2019/12/17/all-about-the-new-ml-super-resolution-feature-in-pixelmator-pro/">a truly mindbendingly cool feature</a> — went from a “worth the wait” type of feature running the old version via Rosetta, to a “wait, is it really <em>that</em> fast now?” feature running version 2.0 natively on the M1 MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Most of the M1 Mac benchmarks we’ve been seeing are testing the CPU and GPU, because that’s something we can compare head-to-head with Intel Macs and Windows PCs. But ML features that run through the Neural Engine are new territory. 15 times faster sounds too good to be true, but it’s true. And Pixelmator Pro’s ML Super Resolution feature isn’t some weird esoteric thing — it’s the sort of feature anyone who ever upscales photos might want to use.</p>

<p>Jack Nicas, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The move, which will have little impact on Apple’s bottom line, is
an abrupt change from the company’s public intransigence over its
fees. For 12 years, the App Store has helped fuel Apple’s
remarkable growth, and the company has appeared reluctant to do
anything to tamper with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would make this change not “abrupt”? And I don’t think it’s fair at all to say Apple hasn’t changed its policies surrounding commissions in 12 years. The 85/15 split, for all developers, for subscriptions after the first year was a huge change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The change will affect roughly 98 percent of the companies that
pay Apple a commission, according to estimates from Sensor Tower,
an app analytics firm. But those developers accounted for less
than 5 percent of App Store revenues last year, Sensor Tower said.
Apple said the new rate would affect the “vast majority” of its
developers, but declined to offer specific numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know how much we can trust Sensor Tower’s figures, but that sounds about right.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple said in a statement that it had made the change because 2020
was a difficult year for many small companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The publicity and regulatory scrutiny surrounding the App Store had nothing to do with it, I’m sure.</p>

<dd>
<p>Apple, announcing the new App Store Small Business Program:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the comprehensive details will be released in early
December, the essentials of the program’s participation criteria
are easy and streamlined:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Existing developers who made up to $1 million in 2020 for all of
their apps, as well as developers new to the App Store, can
qualify for the program and the reduced commission.</p></li>
<li><p>If a participating developer surpasses the $1 million
threshold, the standard commission rate will apply for the
remainder of the year.</p></li>
<li><p>If a developer’s business falls below the $1 million threshold
in a future calendar year, they can requalify for the 15 percent
commission the year after.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The App Store’s standard commission rate of 30 percent remains in
place for apps selling digital goods and services and making more
than $1 million in proceeds, defined as a developer’s
post-commission earnings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t going to make everyone happy, but it’s a good change for everyone involved. But with the structure Apple has announced, there are some counterintuitive incentives for developers whose earnings would fall right around the $1M threshold.</p>

<p>Let’s say a new developer enters the program (and thus qualifies for the 15 percent commission) and their apps are on pace to generate $1.2M in sales. At 15 percent, $1.2M in revenue would generate $1.02M in earnings — putting them over the threshold, so their entire earnings the next year would face a 30 percent commission. If their sales remain flat the next year, the same $1.2M in revenue would earn them only $840K at 30 percent. They’d have to generate $1.5M in revenue to earn the same profit that $1.2M in sales brought them the year before. Basically, if the end of the year draws near and a developer in the Small Business Program has revenue approaching $1.2M, they’re incentivized to pull their apps or reduce their prices to keep from going over the threshold.</p>

<p>These odd incentives could be eliminated if Apple applied the commission more like <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp">marginal tax rates</a>, where you never lose money by earning more income. I would suggest tweaking these rules so that each year, developers who qualify for the program would get the 15 percent commission until they reach $1M in revenue, then get charged 30 percent for sales over that threshold. Let developers stay in the Small Business Program even as their sales grow.</p>

<p>We won’t know the details until December, but I think this system where developers need to apply and get approved to enter the program is just about a vetting process to prevent fraud (e.g. a developer with 10 apps setting up 10 different shell companies to try to get them all commissioned at the 85/15 split).</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Tuesday, 17 November 2020</h6>

<p><em>Better</em> necessarily implies <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>That’s one of my favorite axioms. It’s both intuitively and undeniably true. But it gets to the heart of a certain universal cognitive dissonance inherent in mankind. We yearn for everything to be better. Yet we are resistant to change.</p>

<p>Apple’s new Macs based on the M1 system on a chip, the first Macs based on Apple Silicon, are that sort of mind-bending <em>better</em>. To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are <em>astonishingly</em> good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer <em>better</em>, about what good computers <em>need</em>, are wrong.</p>

<p>Some people will remain in denial about what Apple has accomplished here for years. That’s how it goes.</p>

<p>None of these Macs look different from their Intel-based predecessors. I’ve been using an M1 13-inch MacBook Pro for the last week, and it is all but identical on the exterior to its Intel-based counterpart. Same exact size and shape, down to the millimeter. (The M1-based 13-inch MacBook Pro is 0.1 pounds lighter than its Intel-based counterparts, however.) Same keyboard (it’s good), same trackpad, same aluminum color options (Silver and Space Gray).<sup id="fnr1-2020-11-17"><a href="#fn1-2020-11-17">1</a></sup> Same exact display. Apple never went for those “Intel inside” stickers, and they’re not changing their stance for the M1 just because it’s their own chip. There’s no marking anywhere on the exterior to tell this apart from an Intel MacBook Pro other than the very small print product number on the underside: “A2338”.</p>

<p>Which is to say that the most exciting new Macs from a <em>technical</em> perspective since 1994 don’t look new at all. You either know that the A2338 model number designates an M1 MacBook Pro or you have to turn it on to know it’s different.</p>

<p>I call these the most exciting new Macs, technically, since 1994 (when the first PowerPC Macs shipped, marking the start of the transition from Motorola’s 680x0 architecture), not 2006 (when the first Intel Macs shipped, marking the start of the transition from PowerPC) because while those Intel Macs were exciting insofar as they were new and completely different for the Mac, they were not different at all, system architecturally, from other Intel-based PCs. Intel-based Macs would never be better or worse than the PC state of the art. Strategically, it was a bet that Macs could be sufficiently differentiated by the MacOS software platform and Apple’s hardware designs <em>around</em> the base Intel system architecture.</p>

<p>It was the correct bet, clearly. Intel-based Mac sales started strong and have stayed strong ever since. The Mac gained converts switching from Windows then, and continues to gain converts from Windows now. In its most recent quarter — the last quarter ever during which the only Macs sold were Intel-based Macs — <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/10/apple-q4-2020-results-record-mac-revenue-iphone-down/">Apple booked more revenue from Mac sales than it ever had in any previous quarter</a> in company history, and it wasn’t even close. The Mac has never been more popular. The Mac’s previous two chip transitions, from 680x0 to PowerPC in 1994 and from PowerPC to Intel in 2006, were made out of necessity. The old architectures, in both cases, had fallen hopelessly behind the Intel/x86 state of the art.</p>

<p>The logic behind Apple’s transition then to Intel boiled down to another old axiom: <em>If you can’t beat them, join them.</em></p>

<p>The logic behind Apple’s transition now to Apple Silicon is this: <em>If you can beat them handily, do it.</em></p>

<p>The M1 Macs are such better machines than their Intel-based predecessors it’s hard to believe. Apple’s battery life braggadocio is warranted. The battery just lasts and lasts and lasts. I’ve been using this MacBook Pro almost exclusively on battery power all week, doing both all my normal work <em>and</em> running benchmarks and performance-stressing tasks, and I can’t come close to depleting it in a full day of work.</p>

<p>It <em>never</em> gets hot. In normal use, it doesn’t even get warm. Maybe, sort of, when running a fully-taxing test like the <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">Cinebench</a> multi-core CPU benchmark, it heats up to just past room temperature above the Touch Bar, but it bears no resemblance thermally to a taxed Intel-based MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>It has been noted that the primary performance difference between this M1 MacBook Pro and its sibling MacBook Air is thermal headroom — that the MacBook Pro has a fan, and the MacBook Air does not, thus allowing the MacBook Pro to run faster longer. The two machines are equivalently fast in a sprint, but the MacBook Pro will win a distance race. But Apple doesn’t call it a “fan”. They call it an “active cooling system”. That sounds like a marketing euphemism, but it’s not fair to call this a “fan”. It is something else altogether, and nothing at all like the cooling systems in any previous Mac laptop.</p>

<p>I’ve never once heard it in an entire week.</p>

<p>Never. Not once. Not a whisper.</p>

<p>I presume it has engaged at times when I’ve taxed the system. Again, the Cinebench multi-core CPU benchmark taxes every available CPU core for 10 minutes. But if the active cooling system has kicked in, I never heard it. I’ve never felt any air moving out of the vents, either. This is nothing at all like the fans on Intel-based MacBooks, which, if you’re not familiar, you can definitely hear, to say the least.</p>

<p>Apple, in its keynote last week, emphasized that the M1 MacBook Air has no fan. (Intel-based MacBook Airs most definitely do. The defunct 12-inch no-adjective MacBook was Apple’s only fanless Intel Mac.) Apple’s point there was to brag that the M1 runs so cool that a high-performance MacBook could be designed without one. Some Mac users, I think, mistakenly took this to mean that the Air had an advantage over the M1 MacBook Pro, in that the fanless Air would always run silently, if sometimes slower. I think this assumption was wrong: the M1 MacBook Pro is, to my ears, always silent as well. Whatever its active cooling system is doing, it isn’t making even a whisper of noise.</p>

<p>No Intel-based laptop with vaguely comparable performance to these machines can possibly match that silence. If you care about noise, the game is already over.</p>

<p>A telling example: I configured this machine using Migration Assistant,<sup id="fnr2-2020-11-17"><a href="#fn2-2020-11-17">2</a></sup> porting my user account from a latest-and-greatest 2019 8-core Core i9 16-inch MacBook Pro using Thunderbolt 3. The 16-inch MacBook Pro’s fan ran the whole time, and it clearly got hot. The M1 MacBook Pro remained silent and cool. Just transferring data over Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>After running Migration Assistant, you know that “first login” experience using a new Mac or after a fresh major MacOS upgrade, when a bunch of long-running background processing tasks are running? The Photos app analyzing your entire library, Spotlight indexing your startup volume, etc. Those are tasks that have always been obtrusive, at least on MacBooks. If they didn’t make your MacBook feel slow to use, they at the very least warmed it and made fan noise. On the M1 Mac, the only way I could tell they were running — despite consuming over 200% CPU for an extended stretch — was looking for them in Activity Monitor.</p>

<p>I have a latest-and-greatest Intel MacBook Air here as well, a review unit <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/03/the_2020_macbook_air">from earlier this year</a>. It got hot and the fan noisy just running Software Update to go from the last developer build of MacOS 11 Big Sur to the public release version.</p>

<p>The M1 benchmarks are impressive. Geekbench, Cinebench, Speedometer. Real-world tasks like compiling complex projects in Xcode, encoding video, running Pixelmator Pro’s <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2019/12/17/all-about-the-new-ml-super-resolution-feature-in-pixelmator-pro/">ML Super Resolution</a> image scaling feature. All of it runs impressively fast and yet the machine remains cool and utterly silent. I’ll leave detailed reports on the numbers to other reviewers, who, I’m sure, will conduct more thorough benchmarkings than I would.</p>

<p>What you need to understand is that the best aspects of these Macs aren’t benchmarkable. It’s about how <em>nice</em> they are. The cooling system never making any noise doesn’t show up in a benchmark. I suppose you could assign it a decibel value in an anechoic chamber, but silent operation, and a palm rest that remains cool to the touch even under heavy load, aren’t quantities. They’re qualities. They’re just nice.</p>

<p>It’s like trying to “benchmark” how nice a trackpad feels. Or the keys of a keyboard. That’s why Apple’s years-long butterfly keyboard fiasco was so utterly incongruous. The defining characteristic of a Macintosh computer is that it’s nice. Beautiful in the way that an elegant mathematical proof is. Apple making keyboards that were very much not nice at all was as odd as if a company whose hallmark was raw speed made something slow. One can’t imagine a single Porsche that struggles to hit the speed limit, let alone a years-long saga of Porsches afflicted with the same deficient engine. But that’s what Apple shipped niceness-wise with its butterfly keyboard.</p>

<p>That keyboard saga is instructive, because niceness, unlike speed, is fundamentally subjective. When your North Star can be objectively measured, you can’t bullshit your way out of a failure. Slow is slow. But when your North Star is subjective, bullshit plays. <em>We can fix it with new materials. We can fix it with a membrane to keep particles out. Less key travel is actually better. These keyboard complainers are just a bunch of malcontents.</em> Bullshit. Forget about the fact that the keys were prone to getting stuck or even falling right the hell off the keyboard, the fact is even when those keyboards were working exactly as designed, they weren’t nice. That’s as much a failure for Apple as Porsche shipping cars that aren’t fast. You just can’t put a number on it.</p>

<p>Conversely, when niceness hits — or, as in the case of these M1 Macs, exceeds — its mark, there’s no quantifiable number to prove it. You just know it when you see, feel, and hear it. (Or in the case of the M1 Macs’ cooling systems, <em>don’t</em> hear it.) Apple knows this. The most telling moment during <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/november-2020/">the M1 keynote</a> was in Craig Federighi’s segment, about 14 minutes in — the bit that launched <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/applememes/comments/jv1tfg/craig_federighi_memes/">a thousand memes</a>. Talking about the fact that MacOS 11 Big Sur is Apple’s first version of MacOS ever designed hand-in-hand to run on hardware designed from the ground up by Apple, Federighi’s example was … how fast M1 Macs wake up.</p>

<p>Not compiling code. Not encoding video. Not executing complex ML models.</p>

<p>Waking from sleep.</p>

<p>It’s not like “my Mac wakes up too slow” is a common complaint. This isn’t fixing a problem — it’s making something that has long already been nice on Macs even nicer. This is the Apple way. The Macintosh way.</p>

<p>Compiling code, encoding video, executing complex ML models — they’re all faster too. But the example Apple went to first was purely about being nicer. No other company in the world would choose that example, because no other company gives a shit.<sup id="fnr3-2020-11-17"><a href="#fn3-2020-11-17">3</a></sup></p>

<h2>Memory, and the Advantages of a Bespoke Hardware Architecture</h2>

<p>One thing causing a bit of consternation is that the M1 Macs all max out at 16 GB of RAM. That was true of all Intel-based MacBook Airs, too, but Intel-based 13-inch MacBook Pros go to 32 GB, and 16-inch MacBook Pros and Intel-based Mac Minis go to 64 GB. (<a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/">iMacs go to 128 GB</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac-pro/specs/">iMac Pros to 256 GB</a>, and Mac Pros to, I shit you not, <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/specs/">1.5 TB</a>.)</p>

<p>So what gives? Well, these M1 systems are replacing Intel-based Macs that never had more than 16 GB of RAM. This is one reason why Apple no longer sells Intel-based MacBook Airs — the M1 MacBook Air obviates them all — but is continuing to sell Intel-based 13-inch MacBook Pros and Mac Minis. For now. Apple replaced the 2-port Intel 13-inch MacBook Pros with 2-port M1 MacBook Pros; the 4-port higher-performance 13-inch MacBook Pros (that go to 32 GB of RAM) are still for sale because they’re different models. Their time is coming.</p>

<p>But I think it’s also the case that for most tasks for most people, these M1 Macs need less RAM to perform equivalently to, if not better than, their Intel-based counterparts. This sounds like bullshit but it’s not. It’s the result of a hardware system architecture whose design aligns with Apple’s software architecture.</p>

<p>First, an intriguing benchmark <a href="https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/1326238434235568128">from David Smith, an engineer at Apple</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fun fact: retaining and releasing an NSObject takes ~30
nanoseconds on current gen Intel, and ~6.5 nanoseconds on an M1</p>

<p>… and ~14 nanoseconds on an M1 emulating an Intel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Retaining and releasing an NSObject is a low-level operation that is foundational to Apple’s programming frameworks. Just about everything is an object, and when an object is being used, software retains it, and when it’s done being used, the software releases it. This is reference counting in a nutshell: every time an object is retained, its reference count increments. Every time that object is released, its reference count decrements. When it goes to zero, the system frees the object from memory, trusting that it is no longer in use. Retain and release are tiny actions that almost all software, on all Apple platforms, does <em>all the time</em>.</p>

<p>How this works and why it’s so much faster on Apple Silicon than Intel is fascinating but beside the point. The point is that Apple’s philosophical reliance on this model of software development is not typical in the broader world. This is the way Apple thinks software should work, dating back to the origins of NeXTstep in 1989. The Apple Silicon system architecture is designed to make these operations as fast as possible. It’s not so much that Intel’s x86 architecture is a <em>bad</em> fit for Apple’s software frameworks, as that Apple Silicon is designed to be a bespoke fit for it.</p>

<p>Native code running on Apple Silicon is not 5 times faster than on Intel, generally, nor is Intel software running under Rosetta on Apple Silicon twice as fast as on Intel. But retaining and releasing NSObjects is so common on MacOS (and iOS), that making it 5 times faster on Apple Silicon than on Intel has profound implications on everything from performance to battery life. It’s almost silly how much faster this is natively, and quite remarkable that it’s twice as fast even translated through Rosetta.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, this is a significant reason why M1 Macs are more efficient with less RAM than Intel Macs. <a href="https://blog.metaobject.com/2020/11/m1-memory-and-performance.html">It’s the combination of software and hardware</a> designed together. You don’t have to take my word for this — this, in a nutshell, helps explain why iPhones run rings around even flagship Android phones, even though iPhones have significantly less RAM. iOS software uses reference counting for memory management, running on silicon optimized to make reference counting as efficient as possible; Android software uses garbage collection for memory management, a technique that, whatever you think of it philosophically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Disadvantages">requires more RAM to achieve equivalent performance</a>.</p>

<p>Now that Macs are moving to Apple Silicon, they can take advantage of the same thing. Cross-platform benchmarks show that Apple Silicon is faster than Intel chips, period. But Apple Silicon’s general performance advantage is increased by running software written using Apple’s platform-specific frameworks. If Bootcamp ever comes to Apple Silicon, Windows likely won’t see quite the same performance gains as MacOS on the same hardware. Likewise, if it were possible to install Android on an iPhone, it would clearly suffer to some extent from having less RAM than designed-for-Android flagships do.</p>

<p>Further, I/O is faster on the M1 than on Intel-based Macs. So when you do run out of free memory and MacOS needs to use swap (virtual memory), it’s faster than ever. It’s not magic, of course. If you really need more than 16 GB of RAM, you need more than 16 GB. But <a href="http://hackersays.com/68b2b7">faking it</a> is a lot more fun than it used to be. If you’re using more than 16 GB of memory because you have a lot of small memory allocations that add up to more than 16 GB — like say, a slew of open browser tabs, a dozen productivity apps like Mail and Notes and Photos and so forth, a big dumb sloppy Electron app like Slack, and even something like Xcode, developing a typical application — you really might not notice any hitches with just 16 GB of RAM in these Macs. I don’t. I’ve got all of the above going on right now — plus Fantastical, Tweetbot, Messages, NetNewsWire, MarsEdit, a 12 megapixel photo open for editing in Pixelmator Pro, and of course BBEdit, in which I’m writing this. Activity Monitor reports I’m using just under 7 GB of virtual memory. (This review unit has 16 GB of actual RAM.) Nothing feels any slower or different than when I have just one or two of these apps running. Hell, I just ran Geekbench’s CPU benchmark again, right now, with all this open, and its results were just a hair slower than what I got when it was the only app running.</p>

<p>I’m not saying 16 GB ought to be enough for everyone. If you’re doing work  involving discrete chunks of data that themselves are multiple gigabytes in size, you need many gigabytes of actual memory. But a lot of small things that add up to more than the sum of physical memory on an M1 system does not notably slow it down. As a well-known <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/quit_confirmation_for_safari_on_macos">hoarder of open browser tabs</a>, I was skeptical about “only” having 16 GB of RAM in a new MacBook. But having spent a week deliberately trying to tax this system’s memory limit, I’m a believer. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy one of these M1 MacBooks today — at least the 16 GB configuration I’m testing — with the expectation of using it merrily for years to come.</p>

<p>It’s possible to make good computers with general purpose hardware and general purpose software created by completely separate teams. One group makes hardware that tries to be good for any sort of software. The other makes software good for any sort of hardware. That’s how many enthusiasts think good computers <em>have</em> to be made, simply because that’s how it’s usually worked. But such systems will never be as good as hardware and software designed hand-in-hand together, blurring the lines between which side is optimized in which ways to suit the needs of the other.</p>

<h2>Battery</h2>

<p>As I type this paragraph I’ve been working for just over three hours, nonstop, with the MacBook Pro unplugged the whole time, and the display as bright as I want it to be. The battery is at 80 percent. To say that it offers merely “all day battery life” would require me to work very long days.</p>

<h2>Rosetta</h2>

<p>Rosetta is a marvel — the exemplification of “it just works”. x86-compiled apps run just about as fast as they do on the most expensive Intel-based MacBook Pros, and faster, by a long shot, than on the last and best Intel-based MacBook Air. Let that sink in: apps compiled for Intel run faster in translation on the M1 than they do on actual Intel CPUs in MacBook Airs and most MacBook Pros. Here, fine, I’ll show a few benchmarks from Geekbench (single-core / multi-core):</p>

<ul>
<li>16-inch MacBook Pro (2019, 8-core Core i9): 1,160 / 7,160</li>
<li>MacBook Air (2020, 4-core Core i5): 1,050 / 2,410</li>
<li>M1 MacBook Pro (x86 benchmark running in Rosetta): 1,260 / 5,600</li>
<li>M1 MacBook Pro (native M1 benchmark): 1,730 / 7,530</li>
</ul>

<p>You just don’t have to worry about Rosetta, period. The first time you launch an Intel app, MacOS will ask you if you want to install Rosetta. Agree, and installation flies by in a jiff — mere seconds — and after that, you’ll just never notice whether something is compiled for Intel or native Apple Silicon. You don’t have to worry about extensions (like for Safari or Finder) being matched — Intel extensions run just fine in Apple Silicon apps. Dropbox, for example, is still an Intel app but it runs just fine, including Finder integration.</p>

<p>Rosetta performs great and compatibility is seemingly seamless. This is a technical <em>tour de force</em>, a home run for Apple that will mostly go unheralded by typical users because the entire point is that they shouldn’t notice or care.</p>

<h2>The Camera</h2>

<p>The one spec on these new MacBooks that elicited a universal groan was the “720p FaceTime Camera”. 720p is the same resolution as Apple’s Intel-based MacBooks, whose cameras are universally regarded as <a href="https://twitter.com/joannastern/status/1246494172925886470?lang=en">craptacular</a>. You can’t judge any camera by resolution alone, though, and Apple is billing the camera systems in the M1 MacBook Air and Pro as being improved by dint of the M1’s image signal processing. <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/">Quoting from the MacBook Pro product page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to M1, the FaceTime HD camera can now take full advantage
of our latest image signal processor — improving image quality in
video conferences and pulling out more details in both shadows and
highlights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the camera quality very noticeably improved? Yes.</p>

<p>Is the camera quality now <em>good</em>? No.</p>

<p>MacBook FaceTime camera image quality was so bad that there was plenty of room for the M1 MacBook camera to get a <em>lot</em> better and yet still be described as “not bad” at best. <a href="/misc/2020/11/facetime-camera-intel-m1-a-b.jpeg">Here’s an A/B comparison</a> from a FaceTime call with my friend <a href="http://adamlisagor.com">Adam</a>, conducted at night, with no attempt whatsoever to adjust the lighting in my office in a flattering way. One shot is from a 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro, the other from the M1 MacBook Pro. The difference is striking, even if the M1 camera remains on the whole unsatisfying. (I look oddly pleased, if not downright eager, in Adam’s capture of my image from the M1 camera, and I will get him back for this someday.)</p>

<h2>iOS Apps</h2>

<p>MacOS 11 “Big Sur” introduces one major new feature exclusive to Apple Silicon Macs: the ability to run iPhone and iPad apps from the App Store.</p>

<p>This sounds fine on paper, but in practice I don’t understand who thought this was a good idea to ship. My experience has ranged from terrible to OK, at best.</p>

<p>The best experience I had was using Marco Arment’s excellent <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast podcast player</a>. Everything worked, including syncing with my account, and Overcast’s window, when running on the Mac, is resizable like a Mac window should be. Overcast opens by default in a pseudo iPad-size layout, but I prefer using it in a tall skinny window, more like an iPhone single-column layout.</p>

<p>The gaming experience was meh. Games that I consider a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/07/golf-on-mars">ton of fun</a> to play on my iPhone worked just fine but were no fun at all to play on my Mac. In the same way that games designed to work with a hardware game controller never feel right without one, games designed to be played on handheld touchscreen devices are no fun to play on a laptop.</p>

<p>The most inexplicable experience was HBO Max. HBO Max running as an app on MacOS is worse in every single way but one than using <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/">HBO Max’s website</a> in Safari. The window is, for a video streaming app, tiny, and cannot be resized. Nor does full-screen mode work. You can watch video in <a href="/misc/2020/11/hbo-max-ios-app-on-mac.png">this tiny little window</a> or not at all. Scrolling lists with the trackpad feels like jabbing at a dead fish to slide it across a countertop — scrolling has no momentum or bounce or just plain <em>life</em> to it because I guess HBO coded the whole thing up in some shitty cross-platform framework. Just try getting down to “Xfinity” in the list of cable providers for signing in. (Scrolling lists via the trackpad in Overcast works just fine, full of life and momentum, because Overcast is a proper UIKit app.) The one and only thing HBO Max has going for it as an iOS app running on MacOS, that you don’t get from the website, is the ability to download videos for offline viewing. That’s it. But why even bother when you can only watch them in a tiny postcard-sized window?</p>

<p>It’s possible HBO will fix some of this. Just making the window resizable and enabling full-screen video playback would make the app at least useful. But even at best, like Overcast, iOS apps running in a window on a Mac feel foreign. They feel like what they are: apps from another platform. I can see how some people might think this is a good idea, but I don’t see how anyone thinks it’s a very Apple-y idea. Sure, it works, which is why most companies would just ship it. More apps are better, right?</p>

<p>But they’re such a crummy experience, these iOS apps. At the very best, sub-optimal. This feature exemplifies a spirit of “better than nothing, ship it”. The Apple way, typically, is “insanely great”. It’s like someone said, “Oh, you thought lazy Catalyst ports were a bad experience on MacOS? Hold my beer…”</p>

<p>Each of these apps has an option in the application menu: Touch Alternatives. The first time you choose that menu item, you’re presented with the following alert:</p>

<p><img src="/misc/2020/11/touch-alternatives-alert.png" alt="The ‘Touch Alternatives’ alert in an iOS app running on MacOS 11 Big Sur." width="225" /></p>

<p>The ugliness of this dialog — they didn’t even capitalize “Option” for chrissake — speaks to the experience of using this feature as it stands today. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Folks used to say that no one gets fired for buying IBM. Similarly, no one ever won by betting against Intel and the x86 architecture. Intel always won.</p>

<p>Until now, that is, when it’s clear they’ve lost. Apple’s two previous Mac architecture transitions were made from positions of desperation — they were jumping the Mac from sinking ships. This transition from Intel to Apple Silicon has clearly been made from a position of overwhelming strength. Yes, we still haven’t seen the Apple Silicon chips for high-performance MacBook Pros, let alone for desktop workstations. Many technical questions remain for the remainder of this transition. But the M1 is a rousing start. Apple surely could have initiated this transition a few years ago, but they waited until the effect would be colossal, the advantages undeniable. I chatted with one Apple employee who’d been using this hardware for months, and after it was unveiled, his daughter texted him to ask if the new MacBooks were faster than hers. “Much” was his one-word response. Then he texted again: “Much much.”</p>

<p>You can add as many <em>muches</em> as you want, and it won’t convey the seismic shift the M1 represents. No one talks about not getting fired for buying IBM anymore. Soon, no one will think you always lose  betting against Intel and x86.</p>

<p>Think <em>different</em>, indeed. <a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The M1 Macs’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">★</a></p>

<p>I’ve told this story on podcasts, but I’m not sure I’ve ever written it, and I think the time is right. Steve Jobs was on medical leave for the first half of 2009. When he returned in early summer, he devoted most of his attention and time to crafting and launching the original iPad, which was unveiled in April 2010. After that, he had meetings scheduled with teams throughout the company. One such meeting was about MacBooks. Big picture agenda. Where does Steve see the future of Mac portables? That sort of thing. My source for the story was someone on that team, in that meeting. The team prepared a veritable binder full of ideas large and small. They were ready to impress. Jobs comes in carrying a then-brand-new iPad and sets it down next to a MacBook the team had ready for demos. “Look at this.” He presses the home button on the iPad: it instantly wakes up. He does it again. The iPad instantly wakes up. Jobs points to the MacBook, “This doesn’t do that. I want you to make this” — he points to the MacBook — “do that” — he points to the iPad. Then he picks up the iPad and walks out of the meeting.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs would have fucking loved these M1 Macs. <a href="#fnr3-2020-11-17" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p>

<h1><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_homepod_mini" title="Permanent link to ‘The HomePod Mini’">The HomePod Mini</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Friday, 13 November 2020</h6>

<p><em>This won’t take long.</em></p>

<p>That’s the thought in my head, surprisingly often, when I sit down to start reviewing a new product. I have a fundamental synopsis in my head, an encapsulated summary, and I feel like it won’t take many words to get out. I’m usually wrong. This time I’m nearly certain I’m right.</p>

<p>The HomePod Mini is a delightful smart speaker, and a good value at $100.</p>

<p>Apple sent me a pair of HomePod Minis to review a little over a week ago. I’ve used them both set up as a stereo pair in the same room, and as individual speakers in separate rooms. They’re easy to set up and sound great for the price — and to my non-audiophile ears, sound remarkable for their size.</p>

<p>Do they sound as good as the full-size $300 HomePods? No, of course not. But they sound really good for $100, and in smaller rooms, I’m not sure there’s a reason to worry about the difference. Music sounds great, and they do smart dynamic on-the-fly tricks to adjust to the type of music (or audio) that’s playing, just like their big siblings.</p>

<p>Also just like the full-size HomePod, HomePod Mini does a great job hearing and parsing your voice commands even while music is playing.</p>

<p>One HomePod Mini sounds really good, and while I’m not going to say it sounds like stereo, it doesn’t sound like everything is coming from a tiny softball-sized speaker. It sounds bigger. Two paired Minis — again, just like with the full-size version — sound more than twice as good. It’s really quite a thing to hear, and they’re clearly doing more than splitting audio into left/right channels. They’re working together to fill a room with great sound.</p>

<p>How does the sound quality compare to $100-ish smart speakers from Amazon or Google? I can’t really say. I’ve got a cylindrical Amazon Echo from 2016, and the HomePod Mini makes that sound like a tin can, but that’s not a fair comparison. If you’re looking for a “which smart speaker sounds best” comparison, this isn’t it.</p>

<p>What I do know is that the HomePod Mini seems like just what everyone has been asking for from Apple — a much lower-priced HomePod that still sounds great. Now, you can say, “<em>Well wait, the new Amazon Dot <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen/dp/B07XJ8C8F5/?tag=df-amzn-20">is just $50</a>.</em>” I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for Apple to make a $50 anything. The HomePod Mini might be the nicest device Apple has ever made for $100. I don’t even know what to compare it against, price-wise — I guess the iPod Shuffle, which started as low as $99 when it debuted and dropped to $50 <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1153917/4gshuffle-review.html">by the fourth and final generation in 2010</a>.</p>

<p>The HomePod Mini even includes a 20W power adapter<sup id="fnr1-2020-11-13"><a href="#fn1-2020-11-13">1</a></sup> (which it needs — the hazy touch panel “display” on top just pulses orange if you plug it into an adapter that provides less than 20W of power). I’m not saying Apple should have even considered selling the HomePod Mini without the power adapter — I’m just saying it’s hard to imagine Apple selling it for less than $100 when the power adapter alone costs $20.</p>

<p>All the normal HomePod stuff works exactly like it does on the big HomePod. The big HomePod <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207705">now has the ability to serve as home theater audio output for Apple TV 4K</a> — that’s a new feature exclusive to the full-size HomePods. But in every other way, the HomePod Mini is a HomePod. (HomePod Minis can be used for audio output from Apple TV via AirPlay — <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/homepod/use-homepod-with-apple-tv-4k-apdd878f126c/homepod">just not with home theater features like Dolby Atmos or surround sound</a>.) </p>

<p>I dig it.</p>

<p><strong>Buying Advice:</strong> I’m guessing there are two distinct prospective customers for HomePod Mini: (1) If you’re someone who already owns and likes a regular HomePod, and are thinking about getting a Mini or two for use in more rooms throughout your home, do it. It’s exactly what you think it is. (2) If you’ve never owned a HomePod because they’re so expensive, and are thinking about getting a HomePod Mini because it’s just $100, but are worried that maybe it’s not that good because it’s <em>only</em> $100, you should probably buy one. HomePod Mini is one-third the price of a regular HomePod but <em>way</em> more than one-third the quality. <a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The HomePod Mini’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_homepod_mini">★</a></p>

<p>Here’s a gripe. Apple only makes power adapters in white. But my preferred HomePod color is Space Gray — the power cord for which is also dark gray. It looks mismatched plugging it into a white power adapter. Apple ought to make its power adapters in both black and white, the way they make <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-space-gray">Space Gray Magic Trackpads</a>. <a href="#fnr1-2020-11-13" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p>
