the early days in Wuhan, the first city first struck by the virus, getting a COVID test was so difficult that residents compared it to winning the lottery.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Throughout the Chinese city in January, thousands of people waited in hours-long lines for hospitals, sometimes next to corpses lying in hallways. But most couldn’t get the test they needed to be admitted as patients. And for the few who did, the tests were often faulty, resulting in false negatives.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The widespread test shortages and problems at a time when the virus could have been slowed were caused largely by secrecy and cronyism at China’s top disease control agency, an Associated Press investigation has found. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The flawed testing system prevented scientists and officials from seeing how fast the virus was spreading — another way China fumbled its early response to the virus. Earlier AP reporting showed how top Chinese leaders \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9\"&gt;delayed warning the public\u003c/a&gt; and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/3c061794970661042b18d5aeaaed9fae\"&gt;withheld information from the World Health Organization\u003c/a&gt;, supplying the most comprehensive picture yet of China’s initial missteps. Taken together, these mistakes in January facilitated the virus' spread through Wuhan and across the world undetected, in a pandemic that has now sickened more than 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, the reporting found. The deals took place within a culture of backdoor connections that quietly flourished in an underfunded public health system, according to the investigation, which was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails obtained by the AP.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Shanghai companies — GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB ($146,600) each, the sources said. It’s unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. In a departure from past practice for at least two epidemics, the NHC told Wuhan hospitals to send virus samples — from which tests can be developed — only to labs under its authority. It also made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated, and endorsed only test kits made by the Shanghai companies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;These measures contributed to not a single new case being reported by Chinese authorities between Jan. 5 and 17, even though retrospective infection data shows that hundreds were infected. The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public, barring large gatherings and curbing travel. One study estimates that intervention two weeks earlier could have \u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2293-x\"&gt;reduced the number of cases by 86 percent\u003c/a&gt;, although it's uncertain whether earlier action could have halted the spread of the virus worldwide. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When tests from the three companies arrived, many didn’t work properly, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With few and faulty kits, only one in 19 infected people in Wuhan was tested and found positive as of Jan. 31, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-02-10-COVID19-Report-4.pdf\"&gt;an estimate by Imperial College London\u003c/a&gt;. Others without tests or with false negatives were sent back home, where they could spread the virus. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Days after he first started coughing on Jan. 23rd, Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher, waited in an eight-hour line at a Wuhan hospital. A CT scan showed signs of viral infection in both his lungs, but he couldn’t get the test he needed to be hospitalized.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When Peng finally got a test on Jan. 30, it turned out negative. But his fever wouldn’t drop, and his family begged officials for another test.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There were very, very few tests, basically none….if you couldn’t prove you were positive, you couldn’t get admitted to a hospital,” his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. “The doctor said there was nothing that could be done.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing, which varied widely from nation to nation. Germany, for example, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/78f7c6b4555a28e64dc96d395366290e\"&gt;developed a test \u003c/a&gt; that became the World Health Organization gold standard days after the Chinese government released genetic sequences on Jan. 12. But in the U.S., the CDC declined to use the WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/c335958b1f8f6a37b19b421bc7759722\"&gt;led to even longer delays than in China.\u003c/a&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other countries also had the benefit of learning from China’s experience. But China was grappling with a new pathogen, and it wasn’t yet clear how bad the pandemic would be or how many tests would be needed.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It was very early,” said Jane Duckett, a professor at the University of Glasgow examining the Chinese government’s response to the coronavirus. She said the government was “just trying to figure it out.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, the hiccups and delays in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China’s foreign ministry and China’s top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We did a brilliant job, we worked so hard,” said Gao Fu, the head of China CDC, in a videoconference in July. “Unluckily, unfortunately, this virus we are facing, it’s so special.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;__________\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;None of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits for the biggest pandemic in a century were well-known in the industry. For one engineer from a Wuhan-based diagnostics firm, the Shanghai competitors popped out of nowhere “like bamboo shoots” – all the more so because his company had the factories and expertise to produce testing kits in the city where the virus was first detected.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We were surprised, it was very strange,” the engineer said, declining to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. “We hadn’t heard about it at all, and then suddenly there’s test kits from certain companies you have to use, and you can’t use ones from anyone else?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BioGerm was officially founded just over three years ago in a conference room, where the CEO mulled how to survive in a small and crowded market for test kits. GeneoDx had fewer than 100 employees, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese corporate records database – compared to competitors that employ hundreds or even thousands of staff.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But what the companies lacked in resources or experience, they made up for in connections.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Company posts, along with hundreds of internal emails and documents obtained by The Associated Press, show extensive ties between the three companies and top China CDC researchers in Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese regulators barred AP attempts to obtain credit reports on the companies, saying they were classified as “confidential enterprises” during the outbreak. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Despite China’s efforts over the years to reform public health and push for open bidding in a competitive marketplace, medical companies still cultivate personal relationships with officials to secure deals, according to seven executives from different competitors. Under President Xi Jinping, China has cracked down on corruption, but industry insiders say a lack of firm boundaries between public and private in China’s health system can create opportunities for graft.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Even amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, “there is no excuse for the flow of cash from these companies to the CDC,” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chinese bribery laws also state that any financial transaction has to be recorded and documented clearly. The AP was unable to ascertain whether the agreements between the CDC and the Shanghai companies were documented, but a CDC employee with access to some of the agency’s finances said there was no record of them. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Despite the questions around bribery, other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200220162408/http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/wxzl/2002-07/10/content_297298.htm\"&gt;special laws on the procurement of emergency goods\u003c/a&gt; during major natural disasters. The Chinese government is \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200420081103/http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2016-12/19/content_5150090.htm\"&gt;pushing to cultivate domestic companies\u003c/a&gt; focused on emergency response technologies, including test kits, to protect its national interest.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,” said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. “Anything affecting the national interest can be deemed to be of utmost importance for special regulations... I wouldn’t be so quick to rush to judgement.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China CDC guidelines state that \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201124142048/http://www.nhc.gov.cn/ewebeditor/uploadfile/2015/11/20151106103321705.docx\"&gt;the agency is responsible for maintaining a reserve of testing chemicals to screen for rare pathogens\u003c/a&gt;, but do not specify how to procure them. An AP search of CDC procurement bids did not turn up any records, even though \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201201112435/https://www.whcdc.org/view/6713.html\"&gt;some other emergency procurements\u003c/a&gt; were publicly documented.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The China CDC has about a sixth the staff of its separate American equivalent, and they often earn far lower wages than in the private sector. So many employees from the China CDC have departed for private sector jobs over the past decade, draining its labs of talent.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among those who left was BioGerm’s founder, Zhao Baihui, the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC’s microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm’s predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars’ worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary even as she herself was at times in charge of purchasing, internal emails, records and contracts obtained by the AP show. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao spearheaded lucrative contracts with government officials – such as one worth 400,000 RMB ($60,000) with Shanghai customs officials where her husband worked, and another worth 55,500 RMB ($8,400) with CDC officials in Shanghai’s Pudong district, the emails and contracts show. Zhao declined to speak when reached by phone, and did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China’s cabinet. Before the outbreak, GeneoDx largely imported kits and acquired foreign technology to expand its business rather than develop its own products, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200323151619/http://www.geneodx.com/company_1_1.html\"&gt;according to company posts\u003c/a&gt; and a China CDC employee familiar with its operations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054822/http://www.chinaivdc.cn/xwdt/201910/t20191024_206446.html\"&gt;CDC training conference\u003c/a&gt; on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits, according to an internal document the AP obtained. In November, the company won \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201201071129/http://www.ccgp.gov.cn/cggg/zygg/cjgg/201911/t20191127_13431715.htm\"&gt;a contract to sell 900,000 RMB ($137,000) worth of test kits\u003c/a&gt; to Tan’s institute. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Also in attendance at the invitation-only event was BioGerm, as well as other companies that used the conference to promote their products, blurring the line between the government and the private sector. China CDC staff were invited to join a BioGerm group on WeChat, a Chinese messaging application, which CEO Zhao later used to sell coronavirus test kits, according to a CDC employee and a screenshot seen by the AP. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. Its founder, Li Hui, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190612064729/http://www.huiruibio.com/admin/UploadFiles/ueditor/file/20150529/14328756176020582.pdf\"&gt;coauthored a paper with Tan\u003c/a&gt; on coronavirus tests in 2012 and “jointly developed” \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200804120109/http://huiruibio.com/news.asp?id=14\"&gt;a test kit for the MERS outbreak\u003c/a&gt; in 2015 with Tan’s institute.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In an interview, CEO Li said the CDC routinely contracted with his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He said Tan’s lab at the China CDC had contacted him on Jan. 4 or 5 to make testing chemicals for the coronavirus based on CDC designs. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’ve been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it’s normal,” Li said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Their connections situated the three little-known companies in prime position in January, when a then-unknown pathogen was about to sweep the country and the world and change their fortunes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;_________\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the past, such as with H7N9 in 2013, the China CDC sent test designs to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. It also shipped along the chemical compounds needed – in effect the ingredients – for hospitals and CDC branches to mix their own test kits as soon as possible.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At first it looked like the China CDC was using the same playbook this time. The CDC had found the genetic map, or genome, of the virus by Jan. 3. By the next day, under CDC official Tan, the Emergency Technology Center at its Institute for Viral Disease Control \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201027102643/http://www.ccdi.gov.cn/toutiao/202003/t20200308_213051.html\"&gt;had come up with test designs\u003c/a&gt;. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But this time, the government held back information about the genome and test designs. Instead, the China CDC finalized “technology transfer” agreements to give the test designs to the three Shanghai companies, according to four people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The CDC did not have the authority to altogether prevent other scientists with competing agencies and companies from getting samples through back door routes and coming up with their own test recipes. But it tried to stymie such efforts and stop testing from being carried out. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;For example, Dr. Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, obtained patient samples on her own, found the genome from them and came up with a test by Jan. 3, according to a slideshow presentation she gave in March. But her lab fell under the jurisdiction of a competing agency to the CDC, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. The CDC barred her from obtaining more samples and testing for cases.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There’s no open collaboration mechanism,” said a public health expert who often works with the China CDC, declining to be named for fear of damaging relations there. “Everyone wants their turf.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. Otherwise, the cases would not be counted in the national coronavirus tally. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It was absolutely abnormal,” said a CDC lab technician, who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution. “They were totally trying to make it harder for us to report any confirmed cases.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In secret evaluations of test kits on Jan. 10, the CDC also approved only those from the three Shanghai companies, according to internal plans and instructions obtained by the AP. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Chinese government finally made its genomes public on Jan. 12, a day after another team published one without authorization. That opened the door for more companies to make their own test kits. However, China’s top health agency, the National Health Commission, still urged medical staff to buy the test kits from Huirui, BioGerm and GeneoDx that the CDC had validated, according to internal instructions obtained by the AP. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The evaluations and selections of test kits were conducted with the knowledge and direction of China’s top health official, Ma Xiaowei, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200527190625/http://www.chinacdc.cn/gsywlswxx/bdbs/202001/t20200114_211189.html\"&gt;according to a CDC post on Jan. 13\u003c/a&gt;. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Jan. 14, Ma held an internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, as AP earlier reported. After that, China’s health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. BioGerm began taking orders from provincial CDC staff across the country on WeChat, a Chinese social media application.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’ve been entrusted by the national CDC to issue kits for you,” Zhao said, according to a screenshot of one of the group chats obtained by The Associated Press.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Quick! Give me, give me,” said one staffer in the Sichuan CDC.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the kits from GeneoDx kept showing inconclusive results, the CDC technician told the AP, and eventually her superior ordered her to toss them aside. The kits from Huirui were also unreliable, and the only ones that worked consistently were from BioGerm, she said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The quality was not good. Bad, poor quality,” said a public health expert familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified to avoid damaging ties with the China CDC. “But because they had a collaboration with the (CDC) Institute for Viral Disease Control and… they paid a million yuan, they were on the list.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BioGerm’s test kits were more dependable in part because they used chemicals from Invitrogen, a subsidiary of U.S. biotech giant Thermo Fisher. Huirui and GeneoDx used their own mixes instead, with more unreliable results. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Much larger competitors, including Chinese genetics giant BGI and Tianlong, developed their own kits in January, which were later found to be more effective than those made by the Shanghai companies. But those test kits weren’t endorsed by the China CDC. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“No test protocol, no primers and probes, then of course there’s no way to confirm cases,” said another China CDC employee who declined to be identified for fear of retribution. “And then, all of a sudden, you tell all the CDCs: purchase from these companies, now go for it. Then – chaos and shortage. Valuable time wasted.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chen Weijun, BGI’s chief infectious disease scientist, also said the early products recommended by the China CDC had “quality problems.” When asked why the China CDC selected the three Shanghai companies, Chen demurred.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You better ask the CDC this question,” said Chen, who collaborated with CDC researchers to publish \u003ca href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30251-8/fulltext\"&gt;the first paper on the virus\u003c/a&gt;. “But actually, everyone understands what’s going on, why this happened, right? You can reach your own conclusions, right?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;_______________\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again. But test kits were scarce. Some other cities in the same province \u003ca href=\"https://weekly.caixin.com/2020-02-15/101515683.html\"&gt;didn’t get kits until Jan. 22\u003c/a&gt;, and even those were often flawed. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Samples from 213 patients in February using GeneoDx tests suggested a false-negative rate of over 30 percent, \u003ca href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021493v2.full.pdf+html\"&gt;a study by Shenzhen doctors found\u003c/a&gt;. A March clinical trial report showed that among the test kits certified at the time, GeneoDx was the worst performer, followed by BioGerm. In general, the rate of false negatives for COVID tests varies widely, from 2% to more than 37%. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Philippe Klein, a French doctor who treated foreign patients in Wuhan during the outbreak, estimated that about 20 percent of the tests turned up false negatives. Still, he said, delays in producing accurate tests kits are natural at the start of an outbreak.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The Chinese did a lot in a short time,” Klein said. “It was a new test, so in the beginning, there was a lack of tests, of course.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Jan. 22, the National Health Commission quietly removed the names of the three Shanghai companies from \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200826030307/http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202001/c67cfe29ecf1470e8c7fc47d3b751e88.shtml\"&gt;its coronavirus guide\u003c/a&gt; as preferred distributors. After the Chinese government ordered Wuhan shut down on Jan. 23, the three companies faced massive logistical hurdles to getting their tests in.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Jan. 26, officials set up a fast-track “green channel” for companies to get their test kits approved. The National Medical Products Administration approved test kits from seven companies, including BioGerm and GeneoDx but not Huirui. Li, Huirui’s CEO, said it was because his company was inexperienced in obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial tests. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But it took time for other companies to ramp up production and ship tests in, leaving Wuhan struggling to meet demand into early February and depriving many residents of treatment. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Peng died on Feb. 19. His mother now passes the days gazing blankly out her window, sobbing and lighting candles in his memory.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“In the eyes of officials, he was like a grain of sand or a blade of grass. But in our home, he was our sky, he was our everything,” Zhong said. “Without him, we can never be happy again.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The same pandemic that killed Peng brought the Shanghai test kit companies and related scientists fame and fortune. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In September, Tan, the China CDC researcher in charge of developing test kits, was \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201029033544/http://www.time-weekly.com/post/273641\"&gt;appointed the inaugural director \u003c/a&gt; of a new National Novel Coronavirus Center. In a nationally televised ceremony, GeneoDx’s parent firm \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200910063140/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SU7UyMl4fbh8iq9wNEYb4g\"&gt;won plaudits from President Xi\u003c/a&gt; for “outstanding” contributions in the struggle against COVID-19, including developing a test kit.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Huirui has expanded and is now selling commercial test kits for the first time — not in China, but in Latin America, CEO Li said. And the pandemic has allowed BioGerm to “stand out,” reaching its business targets much faster than planned, said top marketing executive Guo Xiaoling at a trade show in late August at a five-star hotel.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Because of the epidemic, 2020 has been a really special year,” Guo said. “The country and the economy suffered major damage. But for our nucleic acid diagnostics industry, this year has actually been a bonus.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":true,"mediaCount":16,"shortId":"312f4a953e0264a3645219a08c62a0ad","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/312f4a953e0264a3645219a08c62a0ad","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"unitedstatesgovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"united states government","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"chinagovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"china government","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"centersfordiseasecontrolandprevention":{"isPr":null,"name":"centers for disease control and prevention","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[],"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:31:06","socialEmbeds":[],"flattenedFirstWords":"WUHAN, China (AP) — In the early days in Wuhan, the first city first struck by the virus, getting a COVID test was so difficult that residents compared it to winning the lottery.\n\nThroughout...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:312f4a953e0264a3645219a08c62a0ad","media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 07:38:40","audioMimeType":null,"id":"4d7751a0a192415c8ce274151fe3be83","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"4d7751a0a192415c8ce274151fe3be83_1a1aza3c0","externalId":null,"videoMimeType":null,"managementId":null,"flattenedCaption":"Zhong Hanneng holds a photo of her son, Peng Yi, and talks about his difficulties in getting tested for COVID-19, eventually dying from the disease, in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2020. “There were very, very few tests, basically none. ... if you couldn’t prove you were positive, you couldn’t get admitted to a hospital. ...

(AP) — U.S. hospitals slammed with COVID-19 patients are trying to lure nurses and doctors out of retirement, recruiting students and new graduates who have yet to earn their licenses and offering eye-popping salaries in a desperate bid to ease staffing shortages.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With the virus surging from coast to coast, the number of patients in the hospital with the virus has more than doubled over the past month to a record high of nearly 100,000, pushing medical centers and health care workers to the breaking point. Nurses are increasingly burned out and getting sick on the job, and the stress on the nation's medical system prompted a dire warning from the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The reality is December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they are going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation,” Dr. Robert Redfield said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Governors in hard-hit states like Wisconsin and Nebraska are making it easier for retired nurses to come back, including by waiving licensing requirements and fees, though it can be a tough sell for older nurses, who would be in more danger than many of their colleagues if they contracted the virus.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"d78b10b0-2e30-11eb-e1bb-d107474058cd\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some are taking jobs that don’t involve working directly with patients to free up front-line nurses, McMillan said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Iowa is allowing temporary, emergency licenses for new nurses who have met the state’s educational requirements but haven’t yet taken the state licensing exam. Some Minnesota hospitals are offering winter internships to nursing students to boost their staffs. The internships are typically offered in the summer but were canceled this year because of COVID-19.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Methodist Hospital in Minneapolis will place 25 interns for one to two months to work with COVID-19 patients, though certain tasks will remain off-limits, such as inserting IVs or urinary catheters, said Tina Kvalheim, a nurse who runs the program.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“They’ll be fully supported in their roles so that our patients receive the best possible, safe care,\" Kvalheim said..\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Landon Brown, 21, of Des Moines, Iowa, a senior nursing student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, recently accepted an internship at the Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato. He was assigned to the pediatric unit’s medical-surgical area but said he might come across patients with the coronavirus.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Brown's resolve to help patients as a nurse was reaffirmed after his 90-year-old grandfather contracted the virus and died over the weekend.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The staff that he had were great, and they really took a lot of pressure off of my folks and my family,” he said. “I think that if I can be that for another family, that would be great.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The University of Iowa’s College of Nursing is also trying to get graduates into the workforce quickly. It worked to fast-track students’ transcripts to the Iowa Board of Nursing so they could get licensed sooner upon graduating, said Anita Nicholson, associate dean for undergraduate programs.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nicholson said the college also scheduled senior internships earlier than normal and created a program that allows students to gain hospital experience under a nurse’s supervision. Those students aren’t caring for coronavirus patients, but their work frees up nurses to do so, Nicholson said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The sooner we can get our graduates out and into the workforce, the better,” she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wausau, Wisconsin-based Aspirus Health Care is offering signing bonuses of up to $15,000 for nurses with a year of experience.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9795542421\"&gt;Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hospitals also are turning to nurses who travel from state to state. But that's expensive, because hospitals around the country are competing for them, driving salaries as high as $6,200 per week, according to postings for travel nursing jobs.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;April Hansen, executive vice president at San Diego-based Aya Healthcare, said there are now 31,000 openings for travel nurses, more than twice the number being sought when the pandemic surged in the spring.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It is crazy,\" Hansen said. “It doesn’t matter if you are rural or urban, if you are an Indian health facility or an academic medical center or anything in between. ... All facilities are experiencing increased demand right now.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nurses who work in intensive care and on medical-surgical floors are the most in demand. Employers also are willing to pay extra for nurses who can show up on short notice and work 48 or 60 hours per week instead of the standard 36. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Laura Cutolo, a 32-year-old emergency room and ICU nurse from Gilbert, Arizona, began travel nursing when the pandemic began, landing in New York during the deadliest stretch of the U.S. outbreak last spring. She is now working in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and soon will return to New York. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She said she hopes her work will be an example to her children, now 2 and 5, when the crisis passes into history and they read about it someday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If they ask me, ’Where were you?' I can be proud of where I was and what I did,\" Cutolo said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Doctors are in demand, too.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I don’t even practice anymore, and I’ve gotten lots of emails asking me to travel across the country to work in ERs,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The outbreak in the U.S. is blamed for more than 270,000 deaths and 13.8 million confirmed infections. New cases are running at over 160,000 a day on average, and deaths are up to more than 1,500 a day, a level seen back in May, during the crisis in the New York City area. Several states reported huge numbers of new cases Wednesday, including a combined 40,000 in California, Illinois and Florida alone.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;States are seeing record-breaking surges in deaths, including Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky in the middle of the country. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the virus is “spreading like wildfire.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A COVID-19 vaccine is expected to become available in a few weeks, and health care workers are likely to be given priority for the first shots. That could make it easier for hospitals to recruit help.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;To make room for the sickest, hard-hit institutions are sending home some COVID-19 patients who otherwise would have been kept in the hospital. They are also canceling elective surgeries or sending adult non-COVID-19 patients to pediatric hospitals. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A hospital system in Idaho is sending some COVID-19 patients home with iPads, supplemental oxygen, blood pressure cuffs and oxygen monitors so they can finish recovering in their own beds. The computer tablets enable nurses to check in with them, and the oxygen monitors automatically send back vital information.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Across the U.S., hospitals are converting cafeterias, waiting rooms, even a parking garage to patient treatment areas.

But the much-touted operation still relied heavily on U.S. intelligence, coalition flights and planning assistance.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While the planned U.S. troop drawdown in Iraq from 3,000 to 2,500 by mid-January is unlikely to have an immediate impact on the campaign against IS remnants, there are concerns that further withdrawals could set the stage for another resurgence of the extremist group. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Although Iraqi forces have become more independent in combat missions, the country is reeling from ongoing anti-government protests, rampant corruption and political divisions that reach into the security apparatus. All of that means foreign support is still crucial.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;There are already signs of a possible Islamic State comeback as the group exploits security gaps widened by a year of protests and the pandemic. It's a worrying trend for Iraq’s security forces, whose collapse in 2014 allowed IS to seize a third of the country and sent American troops rushing back less than three years after they had withdrawn.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;So how could the American drawdown help IS and Iran? Here are three key ways. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;__\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;1. SECURITY COULD WORSEN\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;American forces returned at the invitation of the government after IS seized much of northern and western Iraq, including its second largest city, Mosul. A U.S.-led coalition provided crucial air support as Iraqi forces, including Iran-backed militias, regrouped and drove IS out in a costly three-year campaign.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pressure has been escalating for a U.S. troop withdrawal since the defeat of IS in 2017, particularly among Iraqi factions loyal to Iran, which have stepped up attacks on U.S. interests. Both the U.S. and Iraq are in favor of a scheduled withdrawal but have been unable to agree on specifics.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Senior Iraqi military officials in Baghdad say the withdrawal of 500 American troops will have little, if any, impact. But local officials in areas liberated from IS, where reconstruction has lagged and services have yet to be fully restored, fear a security vacuum if the Americans leave. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s true we have a stronger army, stronger security forces,” said Najm Jibouri, the governor and former head of provincial operations in Nineveh, which includes Mosul. “But we still need training, support with intelligence gathering.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If the U.S. leaves us now, it will be a big mistake,” he said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Senior coalition and Iraqi officials say Iraqi forces will continue to rely on U.S. air cover, reconnaissance and intelligence gathering for the foreseeable future.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Iraq’s security apparatus is still plagued by many of the same vulnerabilities that enabled the rise of IS, including poor coordination among different branches and rampant corruption. Tensions have mounted as Iran-backed Shiite militias — now incorporated into the armed forces — have accumulated more and more power.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“These vulnerabilities remain and risk weakening the Iraqi armed forces when they are most needed,” Benedicte Aboul-Nasr, project officer at U.K.-based Transparency International — Defence and Security, wrote in a recent analysis.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There's more. The Iraqi military has also reduced its troop presence in some areas because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the U.S. has withdrawn from some northern bases after rocket attacks blamed on Iran-backed groups.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;2. MILITANTS COULD BECOME MORE RESILIENT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;IS lost the last territory under its control in 2017 but quickly returned to its insurgent roots, carrying out hit-and-run attacks on Iraqi forces across a wide stretch of territory in the north.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A longstanding political and territorial dispute between the central government and the semi-autonomous Kurdish authority in the north has hindered coordination against IS. The U.S. has long served as a mediator, a role that would be difficult to fill if it were to completely withdraw.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;IS has also struck further south, including an attack on a convoy in Hilla, south of Baghdad, on Nov. 10 that killed and wounded more than a dozen Iraqi soldiers and paramilitary forces. Last week, it claimed a rocket attack that temporarily halted oil production in a small refinery north of the capital.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;An Iraqi military commander, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media, said the country sees five to six attacks every week. “These attacks have not been to hold and control land, but to attack and go back into hiding,\" he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A previous incarnation of IS staged similar attacks in the years before the group exploited the chaos in neighboring Syria to seize large parts of both countries.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;3. IRAN'S INFLUENCE COULD DEEPEN\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A wider American withdrawal would also enable Iran to deepen its influence in Iraq, where it already has strong political, economic and security ties forged since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The U.S. strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassim Soleimani, and senior Iraqi militia leaders near Baghdad's airport in January sparked outrage and led Iraq's parliament to pass a non-binding resolution days later calling for the expulsion of all foreign troops.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The government later retreated from such threats, but Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi still faces pressure from Iran-aligned groups to eject U.S. forces.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The U.S. has waged a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from Tehran's nuclear agreement with world powers in 2018 and restored crippling sanctions. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President-elect Joe Biden has said he hopes to return to the agreement while also addressing Iran's military involvement in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. A significant drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq — while popular at home — could reduce his leverage.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press writer Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed reporting. \u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":3,"shortId":"72a65818e96586e5b163855abef5968d","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/72a65818e96586e5b163855abef5968d","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"unitedstatesgovernment":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"united states government","isPr":null,"order":0},"iraqiarmedforces":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"iraqi armed forces","isPr":null,"order":0},"unitedstatesmilitary":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"united states military","isPr":null,"order":0},"islamicstategroup":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"islamic state group","isPr":null,"order":0},"iraqgovernment":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"iraq government","isPr":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:31:06","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"MOSUL, Iraq (AP) — In a quest to root out Islamic State group hideouts over the summer, Iraqi forces on the ground cleared nearly 90 villages across a notoriously unruly northern province.

A Trump campaign lawyer is declaring publicly that a federal official who defended the integrity of the election should be “drawn and quartered\" or simply shot.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Neutral public servants, Democrats and a growing number of Republicans who won’t do what Trump wants are being caught in a menacing postelection undertow stirred by \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-media-social-media-elections-71d5469ac0bbccbfe601528a2517b239\"&gt;Trump’s grievances about the election he lost.\u003c/a&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Death threats, physical threats, intimidation — it’s too much, it’s not right,” said Gabriel Sterling, a Republican elections official in Georgia who implored Trump to “stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.” Trump in response only pressed his groundless case that he lost unfairly, neither discouraging trouble nor explicitly calling for it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The triggering of emotions has always been a Trump staple. His political movement was born in arenas that echoed with chants of “lock her up.” His support has been animated over the past four years by his relentlessly mocking ways, his slams against the “enemy of the people,” and his raw talent for belittling political foes with insulting nicknames like “Sleepy Joe” Biden. That’s one of the nicer ones.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv id='6cb5b93851154f5081eeb8480469668f' class='media-placeholder'&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;But in the final weeks of Trump’s presidency, the tenor has taken on an even more toxic edge as state after state has affirmed Biden’s victory, judge after judge has dismissed Trump's legal challenges and his cadre of loyalists has played to his frustrations. As Biden builds the foundation of his new administration, Trump is commanding attention for the agitations he is likely to carry forward when he is gone from office.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I do not think this goes away on January 20,” Eric Coomer, security director for Dominion Voting Systems, said from the secret location where he is hiding out from death threats. \"I think it will continue for a long time.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Tough beans, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said of the state officials who are fearing for their safety.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“They’re the ones who should have the courage to step up,” Giuliani said Wednesday in Michigan. ”You have got to get them to remember that their oath to the Constitution sometimes requires being criticized. Sometimes it even requires being threatened.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;For Coomer, the trouble began around the time Trump campaign lawyers falsely claimed his company rigged the election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Far-right chat rooms posted his photo, details about his family and address. “The first death threats followed almost immediately,” he told The Associated Press. \"For the first couple days it was your standard online Twitter threats, ‘hang him, he’s a traitor.’”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But then came targeted phone calls, text messages and a handwritten letter to his father, an Army veteran, from a presumed militia group saying, “How does it feel to have a traitor for a son?\" Even now, weeks later and relocated to a secret locale, Coomer is getting messages from people saying they know what town he has fled to and vowing to find him.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s terrifying,” he said. “I've worked in international elections in all sorts of post-conflict countries where election violence is real and people end up getting killed over it. And I feel that we’re on the verge of that.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;This week Joe diGenova, a Trump campaign lawyer, told a radio show that a federal election official who was fired for disputing Trump’s claims of fraud “should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot.” This, as election officials and voting-system contractors in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan and elsewhere have been subjected to sinister threats for doing their jobs.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Threats like these trigger an avalanche of them,” said Louis Clark, executive director and CEO of the Government Accountability Project, an organization to protect whistleblowers. Of diGenova, Clark said, “It’s behavior befitting a mob attorney.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;DiGenova later said he was joking. The fired official, Christopher Krebs, told The Washington Post, “My lawyers will do the talking, they’ll do it in court.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As “Anonymous,” former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor wrote a searing insider account of the Trump administration, prompting Trump to tell rallies that “very bad things” would happen to this “traitor.” Now Taylor's identity is known and he's been assigned a security detail as the Secret Service recommended because of the nature of the threats against him.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is unprecedented in America,” Taylor said. “This is not who we are. This is not what an open society is supposed to look like.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Taylor said intimidation has proved an effective tool to quash dissent. “I spoke to very senior former officials who wanted to come out to tell the truth during the presidential campaign, and many were afraid that it would put their families in harm’s way.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But such pressure has not silenced some Republicans in Georgia, with telling results.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Intruders have been found on the property of GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who has defended the integrity of his state's election, which resulted in a narrow Biden victory. And a young Dominion systems contractor has been harassed with death threats. Dominion is the sole voting system provider in Georgia, so the company has been a lightning rod.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There’s a noose out there with his name on it,” Sterling said of the contractor, in a broadside against the rhetoric and threats in the election's aftermath.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Election security expert Matt Blaze tweeted angrily about the threats.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is just sickening,\" he said. “Every conversation I have with election folks, we start with death threats we’ve gotten. There’s no excuse for this no matter who the target is, but going after the on-the-ground technicians and other staff is a new low. Have you no shame?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Said Sterling, the Republican Georgia election official: “Someone’s going to get hurt. Someone’s going to get shot. Someone’s going to get killed. And it’s not right.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump last week called Raffensperger an “enemy of the people,” Sterling noted, adding, “That helped open the floodgates to this kind of crap.” In addition to seeing people drive by and come onto his property, Raffensperger's wife has been getting obscene threats on her cellphone, Sterling said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Arizona, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said she’s faced threats of violence directed at her family and her office.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the White House condemns any violence. “What I will say though, too, is that the president’s lawyers (had) their private information put out,\" she said, blaming \"leftist organizations.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“So we’re seeing that happen to people on both sides of the argument and there’s no place for that ever anywhere,” she said. Indeed, GOP poll watchers said in affidavits in election litigation that they felt threatened and were jeered by Democrats.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A key difference, though, is that intimidation against Republican poll workers or officials by Trump's opponents did not come from the top. Biden has largely stayed out of the fray even as Trump systematically maligns the process, the election workers, the state officials who resist his pressure and some of the judges.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He's gone repeatedly after Dominion Voting Systems, falsely branding it a “radical left company\" responsible for a “stolen” election — in contrast to the assurances of state and federal officials that the election was run fairly and remarkably smoothly in the midst of a pandemic, with none of the massive fraud alleged by the president.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Members of Trump’s administration have affirmed the legitimacy of the election, though at least one, Krebs, got fired for it. Even Trump’s trusted ally, Attorney General William Barr, told The AP he’d seen no widespread fraud.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;For Coomer, Dominion's director of product strategy and security, \"this election was incredibly smooth across the board.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But sometime around Eric Trump’s post-election tweets about Coomer and a bizarre news conference where Trump lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell spun fabrications about Dominion and called him out by name, the real trouble started for him.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Dominion hired third-party security for him, and he was told not to go back to his house. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A few nights ago, he said, he was told in texts that people were watching him, and that he’d better run. Others had already said they’d rented a house in the town where he was hiding and would find him.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s a daily thing,\" he said, \"and no, I have not had a decent night’s sleep since all of this.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press writers Kate Brumback in Atlanta, David Eggert in Lansing, Michigan, and Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed to this report. \u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":8,"shortId":"6e30f557f7a015cc9fda9549d2778670","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/6e30f557f7a015cc9fda9549d2778670","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"usrepublicanparty":{"isPr":null,"name":"u.s. republican party","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:35:55","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The last throes of Donald Trump’s presidency have turned ugly — even dangerous.\n\nDeath threats are on the rise.

Senate Republicans will likely use that forum to extract a pledge from the pick to commit to an independent investigation.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The pressure on the new attorney general is unlikely to ease once they take office. With the special counsel continuing to work during the early days of the Biden administration, it may be tough for the Justice Department's new leadership to launch investigations of President Donald Trump and his associates without seeming to be swayed by political considerations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Barr elevated U.S. Attorney John Durham to special counsel as Trump continues to propel his claims that the Russia investigation that shadowed his presidency was a “witch hunt.” It's the latest example of efforts by Trump officials to use the final days of his administration to essentially \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-israel-iran-iran-nuclear-2038c03b1ba6e95b7accf9daca44eb85\"&gt;box Biden in\u003c/a&gt; by enacting new rules, regulations and orders designed to cement the president's legacy.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the maneuvering over the special counsel is especially significant because it saddles Democrats with an investigation that they've derided as tainted. Now there's little the new administration can do about it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“From a political perspective, the move is so elegantly lethal that it would make Machiavelli green with envy,” Jonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, wrote in an op-ed for USA Today.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A special counsel can only be dismissed for cause. And as was the case during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, such probes can sometimes stray from their origins. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Biden transition did not respond to a request for comment on the special counsel appointment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But Barr's decision could influence whom the president-elect puts forth as a nominee for attorney general. One leading candidate, Sally Yates, was already viewed skeptically by some Trump-aligned Republicans for her role in the early days of the Russia investigation. Her nomination could face even greater challenges because she's connected to some of the work that Durham is examining. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;As deputy attorney general, Yates signed off on the first two applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor communications of ex-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, a process that has been among the focuses of the Durham investigation. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A Justice Department inspector general report found significant flaws and omissions in the four applications to the court, though it also found no evidence that Yates or any other senior Justice Department officials were aware of the problems. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some Democrats have privately expressed concerns – likely to deepen with Durham’s appointment as a special counsel – that nominating Yates would lead to a messy confirmation process that focuses on the Russia investigation, instead of focusing on reforms and shifting priorities at the Justice Department, people familiar with the matter have said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Others potentially in the mix for the role include Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser and senior Justice Department official in the Obama administration, and outgoing Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who famously prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a Birmingham church in the 1960s.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The question for Biden, however, is how to balance top Cabinet picks as he attempts to fulfill his pledge for racial, ethnic and gender diversity. Many of Biden's leading nominees so far have been white, which could work against Yates, Monaco and Jones.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some Black Democrats are attempting to elevate former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is Black and led the Justice Department's civil rights division under President Bill Clinton, in discussions about potential attorneys general.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Whoever emerges as the nominee will be pressed to demonstrate independence from the new White House after Biden campaigned on a pledge to depoliticize the Justice Department.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That could be tough, however, if the future attorney general faces calls for new probes into the Trump administration. Some investigations into Trump have been frozen because of the immunity he enjoys as president. Others swirling around members of his family and associates have been simmering for years. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Tuesday, an unsealed court filing revealed an investigation into a potential plot to solicit political donations in exchange for the president using his pardon power. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Barr, for his part, insisted that he was trying to keep politics out of the Durham probe, explaining that is why he delayed announcing the special counsel appointment until a month after the election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“With the election approaching, I decided the best thing to do would be to appoint them under the same regulation that covered Bob Muller, to provide Durham and his team some assurance that they’d be able to complete their work regardless of the outcome of the election,” Barr said in an interview with the AP on Tuesday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I wanted to have the team, both Durham and his team understand that they be able to finish their work,” Barr said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Durham has already been a huge disappointment for Trump and his allies, and prompted a dispute with Barr over why things weren’t moving faster and why the investigation did not yield major prosecutions in the weeks before the election. The investigation wasn’t expected to result in many more criminal charges, and there has only been one so far — a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to a single charge.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the investigation is worth more politically than practically.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A nearly 500-page inspector general report chronicled in great detail the errors and omissions FBI agents made in a series of applications to surveil Page.

As ratified, the original amendment has permitted exploitation of labor by convicted felons for over 155 years since the abolition of slavery.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The 13th Amendment “continued the process of a white power class gravely mistreating Black Americans, creating generations of poverty, the breakup of families and this wave of mass incarceration that we still wrestle with today,” Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon told The Associated Press ahead of the resolution's introduction.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;A House version is led by outgoing Rep. William Lacy Clay, of St. Louis, who said the amendment “seeks to finish the job that President (Abraham) Lincoln started.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It would “eliminate the dehumanizing and discriminatory forced labor of prisoners for profit that has been used to drive the over-incarceration of African Americans since the end of the Civil War,” Clay said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the Senate, the resolution has Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland signed on as co-sponsors. “This change to the 13th Amendment will finally, fully rid our nation of a form of legalized slavery,” Van Hollen said in an emailed statement.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Constitutional amendments are rare and require approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate, as well as ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures. Should the proposal fail to move out of committee in the remaining weeks of the current Congress, Merkley said he hoped to revive it next year.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The effort has been endorsed by more than a dozen human rights and social justice organizations, including The Sentencing Project, the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and Color of Change.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It is long past time that Congress excise this language from the U.S. Constitution which should begin to put an end to the abusive practices derived from it,” said Laura Pitter, deputy director of the U.S. program at Human Rights Watch, which also endorsed the amendment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The proposed amendment comes nearly one month after voters in Nebraska and Utah approved initiatives amending their state constitutions to remove language that allows slavery and involuntary servitude as criminal punishments. In 2018, Colorado was among the first U.S. states to remove such language by ballot measure.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Although nearly half of state constitutions do not mention human bondage or prison labor as punishment, just over 20 states still include such clauses in governing documents that date back to the 19th century abolition of slavery.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Merkley’s Oregon, voters in 2002 approved the elimination of constitutional language that prohibited Black Americans from living in the state unless they were enslaved.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He said the movement toward a federal amendment is “kind of saying to the world, let’s not forget this big piece of injustice that’s sitting squarely in the middle of our Constitution, as we wrestle with criminal justice reform.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many Americans will recognize modern-day prison labor as chain gangs deployed from prison facilities for agricultural and infrastructure work. The prevalence of prison labor has been largely accepted as a means for promoting rehabilitation, teaching trade skills and reducing idleness among prisoners.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the practice has a much darker history. Following the abolition of slavery, Southern states that lost the literal backbone of their economies began criminalizing formerly enslaved Black men and women for offenses as petty as vagrancy or having unkempt children. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;This allowed legal re-enslavement of African Americans, who were no longer seen as sympathetic victims of inhumane bondage, said Michele Goodwin, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“These people became criminals, and it became very difficult for many abolitionists to use the same kinds of emotional messaging about the humanity of these individuals,” Goodwin said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Today, incarcerated workers, many of them making pennies on the dollar, work in plants, manufacturing clothing, assembling furniture and even battling wildfires across the U.S., much of it to the benefit of large corporations, governments and communities where they’ve historically been unwelcome upon release.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Researchers have estimated the minimum annual value of prison labor commodities at $2 billion, derived largely through a system of convict leasing that leaves these workers without the legal protections and benefits that Americans are otherwise entitled to.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And while prison work is largely optional for the 2.2 million individuals incarcerated in the U.S., it’s a grave mistake to disassociate their labor from the original intent of the penal system, Goodwin said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Your freedom has been taken away — that’s the punishment that society has assigned,” she said. “The punishment is not that you do slave work, that is unpaid labor or barely paid labor.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;____\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Morrison is a member of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

But it was largely a recycling of the same litany of misinformation and unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud that he has been making for the past month.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump, who spoke from the Diplomatic Reception Room, kept up his futile pushback against the election even as state after state certifies its results and as Biden presses ahead with shaping his Cabinet in advance of his inauguration on Jan. 20.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump's remarks raised questions about how far he may be willing to go in his campaign to overturn Biden’s win, including whether he might press Republicans in Congress to block certification of the vote, a move that’s been floated by the president's allies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden received a record 81 million votes compared to 74 million for Trump. The Democrat also won 306 electoral votes compared to 232 for Trump. The Electoral College split matches Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago, which he described then as a “landslide.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump dug further into his contention of a “rigged election” even though members of his own administration, including Attorney General William Barr, say that no proof of widespread voter fraud has been uncovered. Courts in multiple battleground states have thrown out a barrage of lawsuits filed on behalf of the president.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is not just about honoring the votes of 74 million Americans who voted for me,” Trump said. “It’s about ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election. And in all future elections.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In fact, his baseless claims are having the opposite effect — undermining public faith in the integrity of U.S. elections. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;About an hour after it was posted, Trump’s video had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook and shared by more than 60,000 Facebook users. Both Facebook and Twitter flagged the president’s posting as problematic, with Twitter noting that Trump’s claims about election fraud are disputed.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University, said the nation has seen close elections before — 1800, 1876 and, most recently, 2000. But this year's election does not fit in that category.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is just a random baseless attack on the entire election,” Zelizer said. “Trump has no turning point. I often say there are parallels or precedents, but there aren't in this case. He keeps bending norms.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump said the election results should be “overturned immediately” in several battleground states and suggested the Supreme Court should intervene in his favor, saying, “Hopefully, they will do what’s right for our country because our country can’t live with this kind of an election.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But chances are remote that the Supreme Court would get involved. No appeals claiming fraud have been filed at the high court. Pennsylvania Republicans want the justices to prevent certification of Biden’s win in the state, but their appeal alleges Pennsylvania’s vote-by-mail law is unconstitutional, not fraud. The state Supreme Court already has dismissed the lawsuit.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many of Trump's claims have been debunked repeatedly in recent weeks.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His overarching claim: \"This election is about great voter fraud, fraud that has never been seen like this before.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In fact, Christopher Krebs, the director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, voiced confidence in the integrity of the election ahead of the November vote. And afterward, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-fires-christopher-krebs-dhs-5e63923e0c11c9155eb5af2362d78548\"&gt;he knocked down allegations that the count was tainted by fraud. \u003c/a&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Krebs was fired by Trump weeks ago.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Barr, in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, said the Justice Department \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d\"&gt;has uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud\u003c/a&gt; that could change the election outcome.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump, in his speech, delved into a series of baseless claims about voting in battleground states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and beyond. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He alleged that in Pennsylvania, \"large amounts of mail-in and absentee ballots were processed illegally and in secret in Philadelphia and Allegheny County without our observers present.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In fact, no one tried to ban poll watchers representing each side in the election. And Democrats did not try to stop Republican representatives from being able to observe the process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The main issue was how close observers representing the parties could get to election workers who were processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia. The Trump campaign sued to allow the observers to get closer than the guidelines allowed. A court ruled in favor of that request.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump zeroed in on the high use of mail-in ballots this year, citing the \"Democrat Party’s relentless push to print and mail out tens of millions of ballots sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In fact, mail-in ballots \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9202374126\"&gt;have a series of built-in safeguards to verify voter identity and prevent fraud\u003c/a&gt;. Some states mail ballots to every registered voter, while other states mail ballots only to voters who request them. But the ballots are subject to that state’s verification requirements in either case.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Use of mail-in ballots soared as Democrats encouraged their use to reduce in-person voting during a pandemic. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the video, Trump also bitterly alluded to legal troubles he could face once he leaves office. New York's attorney general, Letitia James, is conducting a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization improperly inflated the value of assets for loan or insurance purposes and deflated the value for tax purposes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump fumed that “these same people that failed to get me in Washington have sent every piece of information to New York so that they can try to get me there.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James responded in statement: \"Unlike the president and the unfounded accusations he hurled today, we are guided by the facts and the law, and the politics stop at the door.

Adam Smith of Washington and Mac Thornberry of Texas, the chairman and top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a joint statement.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a rare joint rebuke, they said that “for 59 straight years,” the National Defense Authorization Act has passed because lawmakers and presidents agreed to set aside their own preferences “and put the needs of our military personnel and America’s security first.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"The time has come to do that again,” they said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen.

From taking money from military bases to build the border wall with Mexico to installing his nominees in administrative position without Senate confirmation, Trump has chipped away at the legislative branch like few other executives in recent times.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The president seems intent on filling each of his remaining days in office with petulance, grievance, self-interest,” said Democratic leader Chuck Schumer during a speech in the Senate.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at briefing Wednesday that the president is serious about vetoing the defense bill unless Congress repeals Section 230.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He is going to put the pressure on Congress to step up on this,” she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Twitter has become a publisher, choosing to fact-check content,” she said. “And when you’re a publisher, there are certain responsibilities with that and you should not be immune from liability.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Past presidents have certainly threatened to veto defense bills, which set annual policy with troop levels, equipment priorities, pay raises and other matters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s typically a widely bipartisan measure, one of the few areas of common ground. Over the summer, the Senate approved its version, 86-14, while the House similarly passed its effort, with opposition coming mostly from the liberal and conservative flanks. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Wednesday, the two chambers announced bicameral agreement ahead of final votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When Trump first threatened a veto to keep the Confederate base names, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows floated a compromise that would instead insert a new provision repealing Section 230.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have railed against the social media companies, especially during the heated November election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a pair of tweets late Tuesday, Trump said the country cannot allow Section 230 to stand. “If the very dangerous &amp;amp; unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk,” he tweeted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some Democrats, including Schumer, agree the Section 230 provision could be revisited, even as they disagree with Trump’s tactic of attaching it to the defense bill.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Inhofe said Wednesday that Section 230 “has nothing to do with the military” and should be kept out of the Defense bill. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One Republican, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said he was tasked with showing the White House an alternative approach that could provide some clarifying language around the tech companies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wicker told reporters he wasn’t sure if his proposal would be accepted.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres delivered yet another urgent appeal to curb climate change. It was tinged with optimism but delivered dire warnings, as the UN gears up for a Dec. 12 virtual climate summit in France on the 5th anniversary of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The state of the planet is broken,” Guterres \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BpFEoGK4jU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;said in a speech \u003c/a&gt; at Columbia University. “Humanity is waging war on nature.

Most trapped heat goes into the world’s seas, and ocean temperatures now are at record levels. It also means 2020 will go down as one of the three hottest years on record.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There is at least a one-in-five chance of it temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2024,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said. The Paris climate accord set a goal of not exceeding 1.5-degree (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming since pre-industrial times.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"508d8a90-2e30-11eb-c16b-5f7325a62887\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;A \u003ca href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/829/CAT_2020-12-01_Briefing_GlobalUpdate_Paris5Years_Dec2020.pdf\"&gt;new analysis\u003c/a&gt; by Climate Action Tracker scientists who monitor carbon pollution and pledges to cut them said public commitments to emission cuts, if kept, would limit warming to about 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and possibly as low as 2.1 degrees Celsius. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Guterres saw hope in promises by more than 100 countries that by mid-century they will not be adding more heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere than trees and technology can remove, along with shorter term pollution cuts. China and U.S. President-elect Joe Biden have pledged net zero carbon emissions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year — the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality,” Guterres said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But he said the two U.N. reports Wednesday “spell out how close we are to climate catastrophe.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When countries spend trillions of dollars to recover from the pandemic-triggered economic slowdown, Guterres said they must to do so in a way that emphasizes clean energy. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nations should stop funding and subsidizing fossil fuels, he said. And countries need to fulfill their Paris promise to spend $100 billion annually to help poorer countries develop cleaner energy. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Guterres said there’s no way the world can curb the climate change “without U.S. leadership” and urged students and other Americans to do “everything you can” to get their governments to curb emissions more quickly.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One of \u003ca href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/production-gap-2020\"&gt; the new reports\u003c/a&gt; found countries would need to cut production of oil, coal and natural gas by 6% each year by 2030 to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Instead, a review of eight major fossil-fuel producing nations showed they plan to increase production by 2% annually. That means twice the amount of carbon-based fuel would come onto the market than feasible to keep the Paris goal within reach.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Governments in the Group of 20 major and emerging economies have so far committed more money to prop up fossil fuel sectors than to boost the rollout of renewable energy, the report found.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9809663011\"&gt;Full Coverage: Climate\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Co-author Ivetta Gerasimchuk of the International Institute for Sustainable Development said investing in oil, coal and gas no longer makes economic sense because renewable energy is becoming cheaper than fossil fuels.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not scheduled to consider the vaccine until Dec. 10.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is a day to remember, frankly, in a year to forget,\" British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The announcement sets the stage for the biggest vaccination campaign in British history and came just ahead of what experts are warning will be a long, dark winter, with the coronavirus surging to epic levels in recent weeks in the U.S. and Europe.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Officials cautioned that several tough months still lie ahead even in Britain, given the monumental task of inoculating large swaths of the population. Because of the limited initial supply, the first shots will be reserved for those most in danger, namely nursing home residents, the elderly and health care workers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommended the vaccine after clinical trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers showed it was 95% effective and turned up no serious side effects. The vaccine is still considered experimental while final testing is done.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is an unprecedented piece of science,” given that the vaccine was authorized less than a year after the virus was discovered, said David Harper, senior consulting fellow in global health at the Chatham House think tank.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that the “searchlights of science” had picked out the “invisible enemy,” which has been blamed for close to 60,000 deaths in Britain. He said that in developing the vaccine, scientists had performed “biological jujitsu” by turning the virus on itself.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other countries aren’t far behind: Regulators in not only the U.S. but the European Union and Canada also are vetting the Pfizer vaccine along with a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/moderna-asks-regulators-ok-virus-shots-a65a00cdf9725c9104886ded9052a85d\"&gt;shot made by Moderna\u003c/a&gt;. British and Canadian regulators are also considering \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-f52858d0d5524147270201a0f301e6aa\"&gt;a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University\u003c/a&gt;. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"c4544c20-2e30-11eb-ecfa-393f5470504b\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Amid growing concern that Americans will greet vaccines with skepticism, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Britain’s decision “should give Americans additional confidence in the quality of such a vaccine.” The virus has killed more than 270,000 in the U.S. On Wednesday, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on an expert panel’s recommendation that health care workers and nursing home residents be the first to be vaccinated when shots become available.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hancock said Britain will begin receiving the first shipment of 800,000 doses from Belgium within days, and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-germany-immunizations-coronavirus-pandemic-3ac7e19981b7937f0f08a29667ddf09e\"&gt;people will start getting the shots \u003c/a&gt; as soon as it arrives. Two doses three weeks apart are required. The country expects to receive millions of doses by the end of this year, Hancock said, though the exact number will depend on how fast it can be manufactured and checked for quality.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That is only a fraction of what will be needed as public health officials try to vaccinate much of the world’s population. Experts have said several vaccines will be required to quickly end the pandemic that has infected more than 64 million people globally.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Britain, the first shots will go to nursing home residents and those who care for them, followed by everyone over 80 and health care workers. From there, the program will be expanded as the supply increases, with the vaccine offered roughly on the basis of age groups, starting with the oldest people.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Amid the burst of optimism, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla warned governments against any immediate move to relax restrictions and reopen their economies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The time that we will have to go back to normality is not far away,\" he said. \"But it is definitely not now.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Despite the speed with which they approved the vaccine, and the intense political pressure surrounding the worldwide race to solve the crisis, British regulators insisted “no corners have been cut” during the review process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The MHRA made its recommendation after a so-called rolling review that allowed it to assess information about the vaccine as it came in, starting back in October.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The safety of the public will always come first,” said Dr. June Raine, the agency's chief executive. “And I emphasize again that this recommendation has only been given by the MHRA following the most rigorous scientific assessment of every piece of data.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Getting that message to the public will be critical if any vaccination program is to be successful. Some people are worried about getting any vaccine, never mind a new one. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“But I think once they understand and see everyone else having it without hesitation, I think you’ll find that people will go and have it,” Jacqueline Roubians, a 76-year-old retired nurse, said at Brixton Market in London. “People are dying of COVID, so you make that decision: Do you want to die or do you want the vaccine?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In addition to the huge logistical challenges of distributing the vaccines, the Pfizer-BioNTech one must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pfizer said it has developed shipping containers that use dry ice and GPS-enabled sensors will allow the company to track each shipment and ensure it stays cold.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Every country has different rules for determining when an experimental vaccine is safe and effective enough to use. China and Russia have offered different vaccines to their citizens before they had gone through large-scale, late-stage testing.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hours after Britain's announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to be outdone, ordered the start of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaign by late next week, with doctors and teachers to be first in line to receive the Sputnik V shot, whose name was inspired by the 1957 satellite that was one of Moscow's proudest technical achievements.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Russian vaccine won regulatory approval in August but has yet to complete advanced studies of its effectiveness and safety. Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said more than 100,000 people in Russia have been given the shots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still to be determined is whether the Pfizer-BioNTech shots prevent people from spreading the virus when they have no symptoms. Another question is how long protection lasts.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The vaccine also has been tested in only a small number of children, none younger than 12, and there’s no information on its effects in pregnant women.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Neergaard reported from Alexandria, Virginia.

Murthy has a soft-spoken demeanor and a reputation for consensus building. He's the author of a recent book addressing the human toll of loneliness, a problem that has become more widely recognized in the time of COVID-19.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Alongside his health secretary, Biden is expected to name a top-level White House adviser to coordinate the government’s extensive coronavirus response. Vaccines developed under the Trump administration will be delivered on Biden's watch, a massive undertaking that's bound to have its share of logistical problems. Democratic health policy experts say the leading candidate is businessman Jeff Zients, an economic adviser in the Obama White House who was widely credited with rescuing HealthCare.gov after its disastrous launch in 2013.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Keeping the focus on the virus, Biden is also said to be close to nominating a commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration and a director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Under consideration for FDA are former deputy commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who has also served as Maryland's health secretary, and Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board who formerly held senior posts with the FDA and the National Security Council and has expertise in responding to disease outbreaks and bioterrorism.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Being considered for CDC director is Dr. Julie Morita, a top executive of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which works across a broad range of health care issues. Morita spent nearly 20 years in leadership jobs with the Chicago public health department, rising from medical director to commissioner. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's unclear if Biden will move right away to name an administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the HHS agency responsible for the government's health insurance programs. CMS will play a central role in the new president's efforts to expand health insurance coverage. A number of former Obama administration officials are under consideration.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Health care will be a defining issue of Biden's presidency even after expected vaccines defuse the threat of COVID-19, former HHS Secretary Leavitt predicted. Addressing Medicare’s shaky finances will become an urgent priority before the end of the first term. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare's giant trust fund for inpatient care will unable to cover expected costs in 2024.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If that is the case, they are going to have to deal with it legislatively in 2021 or 2022,” Leavitt said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Meanwhile, millions still don't have access to affordable insurance coverage. And racial and ethnic health disparities remain a festering source of preventable suffering. “The human services programs go through HHS,” said Leavitt.\u003c/p&gt;","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":false,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Biden-Health Care","headline":"Next for Biden: Naming a health care team as pandemic rages","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:082d530752e1e04b8b307b94aebab9d7","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"082d530752e1e04b8b307b94aebab9d7_1a7aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR","revision":null,"mediumIds":["41a886dd743d488ea2c7174981e11fe6"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/41a886dd743d488ea2c7174981e11fe6/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"In this Dec. 1, 2020, photo, President-elect Joe Biden speaks as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris listens at left, during an event to introduce their nominees and appointees to economic policy posts at The Queen theater in Wilmington, Del.

Seated alone at his desk, he offered a stiff televised farewell to the French who had voted him out of office, then stood and left the room. For 45 seconds, the camera kept rolling on an empty chair.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Eventually, the former French president refashioned himself as elder statesman for a united Europe, a veteran of World War II who befriended German chancellors and helped lay the groundwork for the shared euro currency. Tributes poured in from France and around Europe on Thursday after he \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-helmut-schmidt-europe-france-387163c8619330a116a3b5368e3899d5\"&gt;died Wednesday of complications from COVID-19 at age 94\u003c/a&gt;.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“France has lost a statesman, Germany a friend and all of us a great European,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a tweet, via her spokesman.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President Emmanuel Macron praised Giscard's achievements at home and abroad of the man whose “seven-year term transformed France.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He allowed young people to vote from the age of 18, women to legally terminate unwanted pregnancies, divorce by mutual consent, got new rights for people with disabilities.” But he also “worked for a stronger Europe, a more united Franco-German couple, and helped stabilize international political and economic life by founding the G-7.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Prime Minister Jean Castex praised his leadership during the economic turbulence of the 1970s, during which he “significantly advanced the building of Europe and the international influence of France, whose history he marked.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Known affectionately in France as simply by the initials VGE, his name sometimes too long to pronounce, Giscard was president from 1974-1981. He was the model of a modern French president, a conservative with liberal views on social issues. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He was full of contradictions. Like an elected monarch with a technocrat’s skill and a feel for the zeitgeist, he played his accordion in working class neighborhoods. One Christmas morning, he invited four passing garbage men to breakfast at the presidential palace. He calmed a prison riot in Lyon by chatting with inmates in their cells.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But having long groomed himself for an office he won at 48, Giscard then seemed to lose touch with common concerns. When two newspapers reported he had accepted diamonds from self-proclaimed Central African Emperor Bokassa I, Giscard airily refused comment and stopped reading them. After French police arrested the man who had produced documents related to the scandal, the influential Le Monde commented, “France is no longer a democracy.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Giscard eventually countered the charges. But by then a new election was approaching, and France wanted a change. He lost to Francois Mitterrand in 1981, after just one term.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Born in 1926 in Koblenz, Germany, where his father was a financial director of the post-World War I French occupation administration, he grew up with a pan-European view. After joining the French Resistance during World War II, he next saw Germany as a tank commander in the French military in 1944.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In 1952, he married Anne-AymoneIt de Brantes, the daughter of a count and heiress to a steel fortune. They had four children: Valerie-Anne, Louis, Henri and Jacinte.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Giscard studied at the prestigious Polytechnical Institute and then the elite National School of Administration, before mastering economics at Oxford. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President Charles de Gaulle named him finance minister at the age of 36.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After his defeat in the 1981 presidential election, Giscard temporarily retired from politics. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Giscard’s two-volume “Life and Power” he revealed that for seven years after 1981, he read no French papers and watched no newscasts for fear of seeing himself attacked. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“My energy was instinctively applied to the sole purpose of protecting my life, neglecting external reality,\" he wrote.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He then found a second calling in the European Union. He worked on writing a European Constitution which was formally presented in 2004, but rejected by French and Dutch voters. However, it paved the way for the adoption of the Treaty on European Union in 2007.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He was a crack skier and keen hunter. Decades after he left office, a photo of his hero, John F. Kennedy, stayed in sight of his desk, along with those of Giscard and world leaders he met during his presidency. Statesmen respected his world view, expounded with the tones of a classic Frenchman bred to rule. When his stage broadened to include all of Europe, they listened.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He helped integrate Britain into what became the EU in the 1970s – and helped write the article of the EU charter that allowed Britain to leave.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\n\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/25d81d00a2bd7ecf0e6b6f6ee4897749\"&gt;On the eve of Brexit this year, Giscard told The Associated Press in an interview\u003c/a&gt;, “I feel great regret.” He called it a “step backward” geopolitically, but took the long view. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We functioned without Britain during the first years of the European Union ... So we will rediscover a situation that we have already known,\" he told the AP.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Giscard remained unfailingly optimistic in the European project, forecasting that the EU and the euro would bounce back despite the challenges of losing a major member.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Earlier this year, a German journalist accused Giscard of repeatedly grabbing her during an interview, and filed a sexual assault complaint with Paris prosecutors. Giscard’s French lawyer said the former president retained no memory of the incident.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At age 83, he published a romance novel called “The Princess and the President,” which he said was based on Princess Diana, with whom he said he discussed writing a love story. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Asked about the nature of their relationship, he said only: “Let us not exaggerate. I knew her a bit in a climate of a confidential relationship. She needed to communicate.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His office said his funeral will be held privately.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Angela Charlton contributed to this story.\u003c/p&gt;","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":false,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"EU--France-Giscard-Reshaping Europe","headline":"Late French ex-president Giscard helped reshape Europe","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:ab6d66d7891fd86cfef381bb3d998be4","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"ab6d66d7891fd86cfef381bb3d998be4_1a11aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By SYLVIE CORBET and THOMAS ADAMSON","revision":null,"mediumIds":["e424d6c8df4f4f6cb43a4b4588fd6fbc","0035954682e44b629e0037132ed61bc8","80028289d9874731a0b6718d2953c52c","67a41ef31f644c32a3fa12f5497ae9ae","58476fe0351140099569ab7bfaf929bb","59c1c3e70ba24e4a8b8f90849e833b52","484b7097e369418a9d25a0f600b16518","83aa49ec321d4244a1f4b80db6e00b61","14b5f8ce17584426bfb2243cde358648","75ede7540a1e4ecd908a71813aab45d5","284c247b4caf41c1828a5d7d87f4d9fc","f796261418ef4b66a0b5bb4c2fb70390"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/e424d6c8df4f4f6cb43a4b4588fd6fbc/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - In this Jan. 30, 2020 file photo, former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing gestures as he speaks during an interview of the Associated Press in Paris.

It's hard to imagine more consequential picks.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Already one prominent candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services has faded from the scene. New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was offered another Cabinet post — interior secretary — and turned it down, a person close to the Biden transition said Wednesday. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Lujan Grisham's office had no comment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden is expected to announce his choice for HHS secretary next week. That person has to have “the confidence of the president, the ability to operate collaboratively across the government, credibility within the health care world, and the capacity to work with the states,” said former HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt, who served under Republican President George W. Bush.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rhode Island Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo has emerged as a focus of attention for the top health job.

Separately, Raimondo's business-friendly orientation may raise objections from the left flank of the Democratic Party.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Also in the running is former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, co-chair of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/members-biden-coronavirus-task-force-319dee82242fe00091cdf98b8f5df29a\"&gt;Biden's coronavirus task force\u003c/a&gt;. Murthy has a soft-spoken demeanor and a reputation for consensus building. He's the author of a recent book addressing the human toll of loneliness, a problem that has become more widely recognized in the time of COVID-19.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Alongside his health secretary, Biden is expected to name a top-level White House adviser to coordinate the government’s extensive coronavirus response. Vaccines developed under the Trump administration will be delivered on Biden's watch, a massive undertaking that's bound to have its share of logistical problems. Democratic health policy experts say the leading candidate is businessman Jeff Zients, an economic adviser in the Obama White House who was widely credited with rescuing HealthCare.gov after its disastrous launch in 2013.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Keeping the focus on the virus, Biden is also said to be close to nominating a commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration and a director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Under consideration for FDA are former deputy commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who has also served as Maryland's health secretary, and Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board who formerly held senior posts with the FDA and the National Security Council and has expertise in responding to disease outbreaks and bioterrorism.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Being considered for CDC director is Dr. Julie Morita, a top executive of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which works across a broad range of health care issues. Morita spent nearly 20 years in leadership jobs with the Chicago public health department, rising from medical director to commissioner. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's unclear if Biden will move right away to name an administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the HHS agency responsible for the government's health insurance programs. CMS will play a central role in the new president's efforts to expand health insurance coverage. A number of former Obama administration officials are under consideration.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Health care will be a defining issue of Biden's presidency even after expected vaccines defuse the threat of COVID-19, former HHS Secretary Leavitt predicted. Addressing Medicare’s shaky finances will become an urgent priority before the end of the first term. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare's giant trust fund for inpatient care will unable to cover expected costs in 2024.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If that is the case, they are going to have to deal with it legislatively in 2021 or 2022,” Leavitt said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Meanwhile, millions still don't have access to affordable insurance coverage. And racial and ethnic health disparities remain a festering source of preventable suffering. “The human services programs go through HHS,” said Leavitt.\u003c/p&gt;","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":false,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Biden-Health Care","headline":"Next for Biden: Naming a health care team as pandemic rages","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:082d530752e1e04b8b307b94aebab9d7","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"082d530752e1e04b8b307b94aebab9d7_1a7aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR","revision":null,"mediumIds":["41a886dd743d488ea2c7174981e11fe6"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/41a886dd743d488ea2c7174981e11fe6/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"In this Dec. 1, 2020, photo, President-elect Joe Biden speaks as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris listens at left, during an event to introduce their nominees and appointees to economic policy posts at The Queen theater in Wilmington, Del.

Lloyd Austin and Jeh Johnson, who served as the Pentagon’s top lawyer and then as head of the Department of Homeland Security during President Barack Obama’s second term. Both Austin and Johnson are Black.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The competing pressures are intensifying less than a month into Biden's urgent push to build an administration while trying to preserve the broad coalition that fueled his victory over President Donald Trump last month. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And facing massive governing challenges once he takes office on Jan. 20, Biden can perhaps least afford to lose the backing of the Democratic Party’s fiery progressive base. Nearly 100 House Democrats belong to the Progressive Caucus, which may wield significant influence over Biden's policy agenda as Democrats cling to their narrowest House majority in a century. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden has already promised to enact a sweeping pandemic relief bill while overhauling health care, immigration and education systems and fighting for the most aggressive environmental protections in U.S. history.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Progressive groups have cheered a handful of Biden's early hires — particularly Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein to his Council of Economic Advisers — but have been far from satisfied overall. Despite early disappointment, they have resisted the temptation to embrace an adversarial tone as they decide how to flex their muscles most effectively in the new political climate, especially with several major Cabinet positions and senior positions yet to be filled. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Justice Democrats spokesperson Waleed Shahid called Biden's early picks “a mixed bag,” but noted that they have generally been more progressive than Obama's early picks after his 2008 election victory. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The thing that was alarming to me was when Joe Biden said, ‘We already have a significant number of progressives in our administration,’” Shahid said. “I talked to a lot of people, and they said, ‘We have no idea what he’s talking about.’” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Beyond the Defense Department, progressives are gearing up for the possibility of more aggressive fights on Commerce, Labor, Education, Interior and Justice, among other unfilled Cabinet posts. They have already signaled intense opposition to the likes of Rahm Emanuel, a former Obama White House chief being considered for transportation secretary, and Mike Morell, another Obama-era figure being eyed for CIA director. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Flournoy, meanwhile, had been seen as the leading candidate for defense secretary under a Democratic president since Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 campaign.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She stood out as deeply experienced, respected on Capitol Hill and well known on the international stage. But soon after Biden’s victory, her stock seemed to slip as others, including Austin and Johnson, came into consideration. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A leading Black voice in Congress, South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, has openly called for Biden to choose more Black men and women for Cabinet positions. The Pentagon job, which has never been held by a woman or a Black person, is one of the last remaining opportunities for Biden to demonstrate his commitment to diversity at the senior levels of his national security team.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Liberal critics have suggested Flournoy’s views are more hawkish than the president-elect’s, particularly on the Afghanistan War, and some have pointed to her position as a co-founder of consulting firm WestExec Advisors, which provides what it calls “unique geopolitical and policy expertise to help business leaders” and which has become a source of Biden selections for other national security positions. Another of WestExec’s founders, Antony Blinken, is Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, and Avril Haines, the nominee for director of national intelligence, is a former WestExec principal.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There was no reference to race or gender in Wednesday's letter opposing Flournoy. The signatories include the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation; Justice Democrats, which is aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; Demand Progress; and Just Foreign Policy, among others.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They were especially critical of reports that Flournoy had resisted calls to end the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Biden has promised to end U.S. support for the war.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The letter offers support for two potential Flournoy alternatives: Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Advisers for both camps declined to comment, though neither is believed to have emerged as a leading contender. Gillibrand, in particular, is thought to have little interest in the position. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“While we are by no means winning all of these fights, it is clear that a focus by progressives on personnel is making a difference that will likely pay dividends when it comes to policy determinations over years to come,” said David Segal, who leads the progressive group Demand Progress. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He added, however, that “the national security space is more worrisome.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Shahid, of Justice Democrats, suggested that progressives would give Biden a relatively long leash before revolting, even if there are more disappointments to come as he builds out his administration.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The true nature of Biden's presidency won't be known until he takes office in January and begins to work with Congress to enact his agenda, Shahid said. Biden has promised both to fight for big, bold policy changes and to compromise with Republicans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“In the same way Joe Biden said his campaign was a fight for the soul of America, the Cabinet is the beginning, not the end, of the fight for the soul of the Biden presidency,” Shahid said. “If he chooses the path of deal-making with Mitch McConnell, those divides within the Democratic Party will become much more apparent.” \u003c/p&gt;","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":false,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Biden-Pentagon","headline":"Biden facing growing pressure over secretary of defense pick","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:8a3d3fd445fc481f8184a2bf25d479f3","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"8a3d3fd445fc481f8184a2bf25d479f3_0a1aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By STEVE PEOPLES and ROBERT BURNS","revision":null,"mediumIds":["73b0762e11fb4961a09c11fc06669ad5"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/73b0762e11fb4961a09c11fc06669ad5/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - This Dec. 7, 2011 file photo shows former U.S. Defense Undersecretary Michele Flournoy, preparing for a bilateral meeting in Beijing, China.

Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday introduced top advisers he says will help his administration rebuild an economy hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, declaring, “I know times are tough, but I want you to know that help is on the way.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden said he'd chosen a “first-rate team” that is “tested and experienced\" to tackle the country's economic crisis. He picked liberal advisers who have long prioritized the nation’s workers and government efforts to address economic inequality. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Unemployment remains high as the COVID-19 outbreak widens the gulf between average people and the wealthiest Americans. The virus, which has claimed more than 269,000 lives nationwide, is resurgent across the country amid holiday travel and colder weather sending people indoors.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;As he did frequently while campaigning, Biden promised that the U.S. would eventually emerge with an economy that is dramatically reshaped to better stamp out economic inequality. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“From the most unequal economic and job crisis in modern history, we can build a new American economy that works for all Americans, not just some,” Biden said as he introduced his choices for some of the government's top economic posts during a speech at a theater in Wilmington, Delaware, where he has led his transition to the presidency. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv id='725f313a336a4ebbb1ea4983881bbec8' class='media-placeholder'&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Tuesday also marked the president-elect's first appearance since breaking two small bones in his right foot while playing with one of his dogs over the weekend. He wore a black walking boot and moved gingerly but tried to keep things light. As he emerged from his motorcade, Biden pointed to his boot and lifted his leg briefly to show it off. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Asked about his foot by reporters, Biden responded only, “Good, thanks for asking.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The injury, while not serious, again intensifies scrutiny on Biden’s age, given that he just turned 78 and is the oldest president ever to be in his first term. Still, his team has tried to keep the focus on building out its government and upcoming policy challenges, chief among them the pandemic and the economy.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"9fa9afa0-2e30-11eb-ae5c-b984efebb662\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden repeatedly evoked his work as vice president when the Obama administration oversaw the economic recovery following the 2008 financial crisis, noting that many of those on his newly formed economic team worked closely with him then. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Most of his choices will require confirmation from the deeply divided Senate, where some top Republicans have already begun voicing opposition. Biden said he hopes “that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith, move forward as one country.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Janet Yellen, Biden’s nominee for treasury secretary, served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, when she placed a greater emphasis than previous Fed chairs on maximizing employment and less focus on price inflation. Biden also named Cecilia Rouse as chair of his Council of Economic Advisers, and Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as members of the council.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Yellen called the economic havoc the pandemic has wrought “an American tragedy.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“To the American people: We will be an institution that wakes up every morning thinking about you,” Yellen said of the Treasury Department, “Your jobs, your paychecks, your struggles, your hopes, your dignity and your limitless potential.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen would be the first woman to serve as treasury secretary, after breaking ground as the first woman to chair the Fed. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We might have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote a musical about the first secretary of the treasury, Hamilton, to write another musical about the female secretary of the treasury,” Biden joked. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rouse would be the first Black woman to lead the CEA in its 74 years of existence. The president-elect also selected Wally Adeyemo to be Yellen’s deputy, which would make him the first Black deputy treasury secretary. Neera Tanden, Biden’s pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget, would be the first South Asian American in that job. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rouse, Tanden and Adeyemo will all require Senate confirmation, and Tanden, in particular, is \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-john-cornyn-social-media-tom-cotton-6cc54ce93847eab38b2c3a46db4997f9\"&gt;already drawing heavy Republican criticism\u003c/a&gt;. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Budgets are not abstractions. They are a reflection of our values,” Tanden said during Tuesday's event.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;All of Biden's picks are outspoken supporters of more government stimulus spending to boost growth — which Biden embraced on the campaign trail — though their proposals could face a difficult reception in Congress, which has stalemated on a new round of economic relief for months. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The prospects for a large-scale deal could hang on the outcome of runoff elections for both \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-politics-georgia-david-perdue-adf4fe5b05bbcd0bc92968665303ba4a\"&gt;Georgia Senate seats\u003c/a&gt;. Victories in both would give Democrats control of the chamber — and its agenda —- by the slimmest of margins, but Republican victories will quickly test Biden and his team's ability to negotiate across the aisle to deliver on their promised relief for Americans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9784714893\"&gt;Full Coverage: Biden Transition\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;As he has in recent weeks, Biden repeated calls for Congress to pass immediate pandemic relief funding even before he takes office. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Right now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief,” he said. But Biden added that any package passed during the lame-duck session before the end of the year is “likely to be at best just a start” and said his transition team is “already working on what I’ll put forward in the next Congress to address the multiple crises we’re facing.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the meantime, grim economic news is piling up.

The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv id='b29d53a8be2d4986affb78cb6311e25d' class='media-placeholder'&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\" Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan “problem solvers\" coalition.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's another sign of urgency for additional COVID aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn't as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The new plan includes a liability shield for businesses and other organizations that have reopened their doors during the pandemic. It's the first time Pelosi and Schumer have shown a willingness to consider the idea, a top priority of McConnell, though there's been no discussion on the details, which are sure to be tricky.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;McConnell had dismissed the bipartisan offer on Tuesday, instead aiming to rally Republicans around the $550 billion GOP proposal. But McConnell himself endorsed a $1 trillion-or so plan this summer, only to encounter resistance from conservatives that prompted him to retrench. He has acknowledged that another infusion of aid to states and local governments, a key Pelosi demand, probably will pass eventually.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;McConnell wouldn't respond when asked about the Democratic statement. His top deputy, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said GOP leaders might agree to merging the bipartisan proposal with McConnell's bill.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I think there's still time, although it's short, to put a bill together,\" Thune said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Any relief package would be attached to a $1.4 trillion year-end spending bill required to avert a government shutdown next weekend. Talks on that measure are proceeding but if lawmakers should stumble, a temporary spending bill would be needed as a bridge into next year.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a split-the-difference solution to the protracted impasse, hoping to speed overdue help to a hurting nation before Congress adjourns for the holidays. It was a sign that some lawmakers reluctant to adjourn for the year without approving some pandemic aid.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Their proposal includes $228 billion to extend and upgrade “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses for a second round of relief to hard-hit businesses such as restaurants.

Senate Republicans will likely use that forum to extract a pledge from the pick to commit to an independent investigation.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The pressure on the new attorney general is unlikely to ease once they take office. With the special counsel continuing to work during the early days of the Biden administration, it may be tough for the Justice Department's new leadership to launch investigations of President Donald Trump and his associates without seeming to be swayed by political considerations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Barr elevated U.S. Attorney John Durham to special counsel as Trump continues to propel his claims that the Russia investigation that shadowed his presidency was a “witch hunt.” It's the latest example of efforts by Trump officials to use the final days of his administration to essentially \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-israel-iran-iran-nuclear-2038c03b1ba6e95b7accf9daca44eb85\"&gt;box Biden in\u003c/a&gt; by enacting new rules, regulations and orders designed to cement the president's legacy.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the maneuvering over the special counsel is especially significant because it saddles Democrats with an investigation that they've derided as tainted. Now there's little the new administration can do about it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“From a political perspective, the move is so elegantly lethal that it would make Machiavelli green with envy,” Jonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, wrote in an op-ed for USA Today.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A special counsel can only be dismissed for cause. And as was the case during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, such probes can sometimes stray from their origins. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Biden transition did not respond to a request for comment on the special counsel appointment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But Barr's decision could influence whom the president-elect puts forth as a nominee for attorney general. One leading candidate, Sally Yates, was already viewed skeptically by some Trump-aligned Republicans for her role in the early days of the Russia investigation. Her nomination could face even greater challenges because she's connected to some of the work that Durham is examining. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;As deputy attorney general, Yates signed off on the first two applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor communications of ex-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, a process that has been among the focuses of the Durham investigation. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A Justice Department inspector general report found significant flaws and omissions in the four applications to the court, though it also found no evidence that Yates or any other senior Justice Department officials were aware of the problems. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some Democrats have privately expressed concerns – likely to deepen with Durham’s appointment as a special counsel – that nominating Yates would lead to a messy confirmation process that focuses on the Russia investigation, instead of focusing on reforms and shifting priorities at the Justice Department, people familiar with the matter have said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Others potentially in the mix for the role include Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser and senior Justice Department official in the Obama administration, and outgoing Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who famously prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a Birmingham church in the 1960s.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The question for Biden, however, is how to balance top Cabinet picks as he attempts to fulfill his pledge for racial, ethnic and gender diversity. Many of Biden's leading nominees so far have been white, which could work against Yates, Monaco and Jones.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some Black Democrats are attempting to elevate former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is Black and led the Justice Department's civil rights division under President Bill Clinton, in discussions about potential attorneys general.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Whoever emerges as the nominee will be pressed to demonstrate independence from the new White House after Biden campaigned on a pledge to depoliticize the Justice Department.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That could be tough, however, if the future attorney general faces calls for new probes into the Trump administration. Some investigations into Trump have been frozen because of the immunity he enjoys as president. Others swirling around members of his family and associates have been simmering for years. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Tuesday, an unsealed court filing revealed an investigation into a potential plot to solicit political donations in exchange for the president using his pardon power. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Barr, for his part, insisted that he was trying to keep politics out of the Durham probe, explaining that is why he delayed announcing the special counsel appointment until a month after the election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“With the election approaching, I decided the best thing to do would be to appoint them under the same regulation that covered Bob Muller, to provide Durham and his team some assurance that they’d be able to complete their work regardless of the outcome of the election,” Barr said in an interview with the AP on Tuesday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I wanted to have the team, both Durham and his team understand that they be able to finish their work,” Barr said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Durham has already been a huge disappointment for Trump and his allies, and prompted a dispute with Barr over why things weren’t moving faster and why the investigation did not yield major prosecutions in the weeks before the election. The investigation wasn’t expected to result in many more criminal charges, and there has only been one so far — a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to a single charge.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the investigation is worth more politically than practically.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A nearly 500-page inspector general report chronicled in great detail the errors and omissions FBI agents made in a series of applications to surveil Page. Declassified documents released by congressional Republicans have raised additional questions while not undercutting the overarching legitimacy of the Russia probe. And the facts of the one criminal case Durham has brought so far, against an FBI lawyer who admitted altering an email, were already mostly laid out in the watchdog report.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There’s also been a degree of turmoil within Durham’s ranks as one of the team’s leaders, Nora Dannehy, resigned months ago, a significant departure given the active role she had played.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Miller reported from Wilmington, Delaware.

dining tents a safe way to eat out during the pandemic?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Health experts say outdoor dining tents are generally safer than dining inside, but caution that they’re not all equal.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many restaurants are erecting individual tents, igloos and other outdoor structures that let people who are dining together avoid being indoors, where the coronavirus spreads more easily. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Experts say the structures should be well-ventilated. A tent with four walls and a roof, for example, might not have better ventilation than an indoor dining room.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The more airflow through the structure, the better it is,” says Dr. Isaac Weisfuse, a public health expert at Cornell University. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Igloos and individual tents are a creative solution but shouldn’t be shared with people who aren’t in your household, says Craig Hedberg, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"7ed4ea30-2e30-11eb-9227-9953f8be21a5\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If it’s keeping you from being in a common airspace with other people, then that’s a good thing,” he says.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Between parties, tents should be cleaned and left open for at least 20 minutes, says Aubree Gordon, an associate professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. She also suggests servers should be able to leave food on a tray outside to minimize contact with diners.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Tents are helping many restaurants get through lean times. But they may cost extra. In Detroit, Lumen restaurant charges $30 per person to reserve a heated structure with windows for two hours. Lumen's igloos and greenhouses can each seat six people, and the party must spend at least $300. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9780973032\"&gt;Full Coverage: Viral Questions\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Once a party leaves, the structure is cleaned, sprayed with sanitizing fog and aired out for 30 minutes, says Gabby Milton, the restaurant’s managing partner.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;_____\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in this \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/viral-questions\"&gt;series\u003c/a&gt;.

does emergency use of a COVID-19 vaccine mean?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's when regulators allow shots to be given to certain people while studies of safety and effectiveness are ongoing.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Before any vaccine is permitted in the U.S., it must be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, which requires study in thousands of people. Normally, the process to approve a new vaccine can take about a decade. But the federal government is using various methods to dramatically speed up the process for COVID-19 vaccines.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;During a health crisis, the FDA can loosen its normal scientific standards to allow emergency use of experimental drugs, devices, vaccines and other medical products. The first vaccines to get the provisional green light in the U.S. are almost certain to be made available under this process, known as emergency use authorization.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Instead of the usual requirement of “substantial evidence” of safety and effectiveness for approval, the FDA can allow products onto the market as long as their benefits are likely to outweigh their risks. It has already used its emergency powers to authorize hundreds of coronavirus tests and a handful of treatments during the pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"03a57e40-0720-11eb-af40-cdcdc0ba8bb4\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the agency has almost no experience granting emergency use for vaccines and has laid out extra standards it will use to make decisions on upcoming COVID-19 shots. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In October, FDA officials told vaccine makers they should have two months of safety follow-up from half of the people enrolled in their studies before requesting emergency authorization. That data is expected to be enough for FDA to allow vaccinations of certain high-risk groups, such as front-line health workers and nursing home residents. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Full approval of a vaccine will likely require six months of safety follow-up as well as extensive inspections of company manufacturing sites. The leading vaccine makers are not expected to complete that process until next spring or summer. Only then is the FDA expected to grant full approval, which would allow vaccinations of the general population.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9744717510\"&gt;Full Coverage: Viral Questions\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/viral-questions\"&gt;this series\u003c/a&gt;.

It's hard to imagine more consequential picks.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Already one prominent candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services has faded from the scene. New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was offered another Cabinet post — interior secretary — and turned it down, a person close to the Biden transition said Wednesday. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Lujan Grisham's office had no comment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden is expected to announce his choice for HHS secretary next week. That person has to have “the confidence of the president, the ability to operate collaboratively across the government, credibility within the health care world, and the capacity to work with the states,” said former HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt, who served under Republican President George W. Bush.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rhode Island Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo has emerged as a focus of attention for the top health job. Although \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rhode-island-gina-raimondo-coronavirus-pandemic-4053d950ef34331ba57414fb78d8e760\"&gt;Raimondo has been aggressive in confronting the virus\u003c/a&gt;, her state is facing a dangerous surge and struggling to flatten the curve. Separately, Raimondo's business-friendly orientation may raise objections from the left flank of the Democratic Party.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Also in the running is former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, co-chair of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/members-biden-coronavirus-task-force-319dee82242fe00091cdf98b8f5df29a\"&gt;Biden's coronavirus task force\u003c/a&gt;. Murthy has a soft-spoken demeanor and a reputation for consensus building. He's the author of a recent book addressing the human toll of loneliness, a problem that has become more widely recognized in the time of COVID-19.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Alongside his health secretary, Biden is expected to name a top-level White House adviser to coordinate the government’s extensive coronavirus response. Vaccines developed under the Trump administration will be delivered on Biden's watch, a massive undertaking that's bound to have its share of logistical problems. Democratic health policy experts say the leading candidate is businessman Jeff Zients, an economic adviser in the Obama White House who was widely credited with rescuing HealthCare.gov after its disastrous launch in 2013.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Keeping the focus on the virus, Biden is also said to be close to nominating a commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration and a director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Under consideration for FDA are former deputy commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who has also served as Maryland's health secretary, and Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board who formerly held senior posts with the FDA and the National Security Council and has expertise in responding to disease outbreaks and bioterrorism.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Being considered for CDC director is Dr. Julie Morita, a top executive of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which works across a broad range of health care issues. Morita spent nearly 20 years in leadership jobs with the Chicago public health department, rising from medical director to commissioner. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's unclear if Biden will move right away to name an administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the HHS agency responsible for the government's health insurance programs. CMS will play a central role in the new president's efforts to expand health insurance coverage. A number of former Obama administration officials are under consideration.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Health care will be a defining issue of Biden's presidency even after expected vaccines defuse the threat of COVID-19, former HHS Secretary Leavitt predicted. Addressing Medicare’s shaky finances will become an urgent priority before the end of the first term. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare's giant trust fund for inpatient care will unable to cover expected costs in 2024.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If that is the case, they are going to have to deal with it legislatively in 2021 or 2022,” Leavitt said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Meanwhile, millions still don't have access to affordable insurance coverage. And racial and ethnic health disparities remain a festering source of preventable suffering. “The human services programs go through HHS,” said Leavitt.\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":1,"shortId":"082d530752e1e04b8b307b94aebab9d7","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/082d530752e1e04b8b307b94aebab9d7","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"usfoodanddrugadministration":{"isPr":null,"name":"u.s. food and drug administration","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"unitedstatesgovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"united states government","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"usdepartmentofhealthandhumanservices":{"isPr":null,"name":"u.s. department of health and human services","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:35:55","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Up soon for President-elect Joe Biden: naming his top health care officials as the coronavirus pandemic rages.

Seated alone at his desk, he offered a stiff televised farewell to the French who had voted him out of office, then stood and left the room. For 45 seconds, the camera kept rolling on an empty chair.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Eventually, the former French president refashioned himself as elder statesman for a united Europe, a veteran of World War II who befriended German chancellors and helped lay the groundwork for the shared euro currency. Tributes poured in from France and around Europe on Thursday after he \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-helmut-schmidt-europe-france-387163c8619330a116a3b5368e3899d5\"&gt;died Wednesday of complications from COVID-19 at age 94\u003c/a&gt;.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“France has lost a statesman, Germany a friend and all of us a great European,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a tweet, via her spokesman.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President Emmanuel Macron praised Giscard's achievements at home and abroad of the man whose “seven-year term transformed France.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He allowed young people to vote from the age of 18, women to legally terminate unwanted pregnancies, divorce by mutual consent, got new rights for people with disabilities.” But he also “worked for a stronger Europe, a more united Franco-German couple, and helped stabilize international political and economic life by founding the G-7.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Prime Minister Jean Castex praised his leadership during the economic turbulence of the 1970s, during which he “significantly advanced the building of Europe and the international influence of France, whose history he marked.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Known affectionately in France as simply by the initials VGE, his name sometimes too long to pronounce, Giscard was president from 1974-1981. He was the model of a modern French president, a conservative with liberal views on social issues. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He was full of contradictions. Like an elected monarch with a technocrat’s skill and a feel for the zeitgeist, he played his accordion in working class neighborhoods. One Christmas morning, he invited four passing garbage men to breakfast at the presidential palace. He calmed a prison riot in Lyon by chatting with inmates in their cells.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But having long groomed himself for an office he won at 48, Giscard then seemed to lose touch with common concerns. When two newspapers reported he had accepted diamonds from self-proclaimed Central African Emperor Bokassa I, Giscard airily refused comment and stopped reading them. After French police arrested the man who had produced documents related to the scandal, the influential Le Monde commented, “France is no longer a democracy.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Giscard eventually countered the charges. But by then a new election was approaching, and France wanted a change. He lost to Francois Mitterrand in 1981, after just one term.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Born in 1926 in Koblenz, Germany, where his father was a financial director of the post-World War I French occupation administration, he grew up with a pan-European view. After joining the French Resistance during World War II, he next saw Germany as a tank commander in the French military in 1944.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In 1952, he married Anne-AymoneIt de Brantes, the daughter of a count and heiress to a steel fortune. They had four children: Valerie-Anne, Louis, Henri and Jacinte.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Giscard studied at the prestigious Polytechnical Institute and then the elite National School of Administration, before mastering economics at Oxford. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President Charles de Gaulle named him finance minister at the age of 36.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After his defeat in the 1981 presidential election, Giscard temporarily retired from politics. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Giscard’s two-volume “Life and Power” he revealed that for seven years after 1981, he read no French papers and watched no newscasts for fear of seeing himself attacked. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“My energy was instinctively applied to the sole purpose of protecting my life, neglecting external reality,\" he wrote.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He then found a second calling in the European Union. He worked on writing a European Constitution which was formally presented in 2004, but rejected by French and Dutch voters. However, it paved the way for the adoption of the Treaty on European Union in 2007.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He was a crack skier and keen hunter. Decades after he left office, a photo of his hero, John F. Kennedy, stayed in sight of his desk, along with those of Giscard and world leaders he met during his presidency. Statesmen respected his world view, expounded with the tones of a classic Frenchman bred to rule. When his stage broadened to include all of Europe, they listened.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He helped integrate Britain into what became the EU in the 1970s – and helped write the article of the EU charter that allowed Britain to leave.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\n\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/25d81d00a2bd7ecf0e6b6f6ee4897749\"&gt;On the eve of Brexit this year, Giscard told The Associated Press in an interview\u003c/a&gt;, “I feel great regret.” He called it a “step backward” geopolitically, but took the long view. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We functioned without Britain during the first years of the European Union ... So we will rediscover a situation that we have already known,\" he told the AP.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Giscard remained unfailingly optimistic in the European project, forecasting that the EU and the euro would bounce back despite the challenges of losing a major member.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Earlier this year, a German journalist accused Giscard of repeatedly grabbing her during an interview, and filed a sexual assault complaint with Paris prosecutors. Giscard’s French lawyer said the former president retained no memory of the incident.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At age 83, he published a romance novel called “The Princess and the President,” which he said was based on Princess Diana, with whom he said he discussed writing a love story. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Asked about the nature of their relationship, he said only: “Let us not exaggerate.

Spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a daily briefing that WeChat's management had their “own rules and regulations, and they have the right to handle business concerning WeChat according to their own rules.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Earlier this week, Morrison expressed indignation and anger at the tweet posted by a Chinese official that showed a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child’s throat.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The post took aim at alleged unlawful killings and abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Morrison called the tweet “truly repugnant” and “deeply offensive” and demanded an apology from China. But China did not back down, saying that Australia should be the one examining its actions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Thursday, Morrison took a much different approach, telling reporters in Canberra that his aim was for the two countries to have a “happy coexistence.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“My position and my government’s position is to seek constructive engagement,\" he said. “The relationship with China is a mutually beneficial one. It supports both our countries, it is good for both of our countries.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China is Australia's largest trading partner. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Morrison said Australia had made its views very clear on both the tweet and the WeChat message.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;WeChat is ubiquitous in China and is used for everything from getting news to making electronic payments. The company is held responsible for ensuring content doesn't attract negative attention, and censorship is relatively common.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he was disappointed about both the tweet and the deleted post. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“What the prime minister did in his WeChat message before it was disappointingly deleted was he made it very clear Australia is proud of its servicemen and women who wear the uniform,” Frydenberg said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.

Government offices and many private companies asked their employees to come in late, and the country’s stock market delayed its opening to clear roads for test-takers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;This year’s exam had been originally scheduled for November but was delayed due to the virus outbreak. Experts say on-and-off online classes have widened the gap between high achievers and low performing students due to reduced interaction with teachers, digital distractions and technical difficulties.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If the exam had been delayed again, our kids would have felt much more psychological pressure ... I think it’s fortunate the exam is taking place now,” said Kim Sun-wha, the mother of a test-taker. “I hope everyone will avoid making mistakes, do their best and get good results.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mothers hugged their children and patted their backs before they entered a temporary exam site set up at a high school in Seoul. One shouted, “Don’t be nervous! Do Well!” and another screamed “Cheer up!” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Students were required to have their temperature taken before entering the test sites, wear masks throughout the exam and maintain their distance from each other. They had to bring their own water and lunch because they weren't allowed to use water purifiers or drinking fountains at the sites or go outside to get meals. Those with a fever were to go to separate testing areas. There were a total of 1,383 sites, an increase of 198 from last year, according to the Education Ministry. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;In recent days, the government has urged the public to stay home and avoid social gatherings as much as possible to provide a safe environment for those taking the exams. Park Yu-mi, an anti-virus official in Seoul, said authorities asked companies to have at least one-third of their employees work from home.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There are worries that the nationwide exam could accelerate the spread of the virus. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;During a briefing Thursday, health official Lee Sang-won said he felt “really sorry” that he had to ask students to be vigilant and avoid gatherings even after the exam is over. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’d like to offer words of consolation to test-takers who have studied and come to take the exam under a particularly difficult situation,” Lee said. “I want to tell you to put aside stress and enjoy yourselves fully (after the test), but it’s regrettable that I can’t say that under the current situation.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;South Korea has relatively successfully contained previous viral outbreaks this year thanks to its internationally acclaimed rapid tracing, testing and treatment strategy, combined with the widespread public use of masks. But it’s now grappling with a spike in infections after it eased distancing rules in October. Authorities last week restored stringent distancing restrictions in the greater Seoul area and other places. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Thursday, South Korea reported 540 new cases, taking the total to 35,703 with 529 deaths.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press journalists Kim Tong-hyung and Kim Yong Ho contributed to this

after a day of gains on most Asian markets. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Progress toward rolling out coronavirus vaccines and talk of reaching a compromise on new help for the U.S. economy have been spurring advances on world markets.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As countries prepare to begin vaccinating health care workers and others at high risk against the coronavirus, hopes are rising that the pandemic will be brought under control, allowing economies to recover. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Germany's DAX slipped 2% to 13,292.83 and the CAC 40 in France also gave up 0.2% to 5,571.17. In Britain, the FTSE 100 was flat, at 6,464.60. Wall Street futures also were little changed with the contracts for the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow industrials down less than 0.1%.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;During Asian trading, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo edged up less than 0.1% to 26,809.37, its highest close in more than 29 years.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The rollout of a vaccine in the U.S. could begin this month, if regulators give their approval. Drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech said they won permission for emergency use of their COVID-19 vaccine in Britain, which will be one of the first countries to begin vaccinating its population against the virus. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The vaccine is the world’s first coronavirus shot that’s backed by rigorous science and is viewed as a major step toward eventually ending the pandemic. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The vaccine has been the big prize for risk markets,\" Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary. Vaccinations will reduce virus counts, resulting in a “collective demand lift for the world economy, and global geopolitical risk has also diminished after the U.S. presidential election. A much clearer view across the valley to economic recovery should mean more upside,\" he said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.7% to 26,728.50 and South Korea's Kospi added 0.5% to 2,696.22. In Australia, the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 picked up 0.4% to 6,615.30. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Shanghai Composite index shed 0.2% to 3,442.14. India's Sensex edged 0.1% higher and shares were mixed in Southeast Asia. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Overnight, the S&amp;amp;P 500 index rose 0.2% to an all-time high of 3,669.01, a second straight record close. The benchmark is now up about 13.6% for the year. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Unemployment remains high as the COVID-19 outbreak widens the gulf between average people and the wealthiest Americans. Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that its latest survey of private U.S. employers shows they added 307,000 jobs last month. That fell short of Wall Street analysts’ expectations for a gain of 405,000 jobs, according to FactSet.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The report precedes a broader jobs survey from the Labor Department due out Friday. Economists are forecasting that will show employers added about 441,000 jobs in November, down from a gain of 638,000 in October.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Traders are hoping Democrats and Republicans may reach a deal on some amount of economic stimulus for the economy before 2021, though they remain divided on the details and the cost. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-small-business-financial-services-jerome-powell-steven-mnuchin-f2e1003d63d92408d59210cb2ddef298\"&gt;told lawmakers\u003c/a&gt; during a House Financial Services Committee hearing that Congress needs to approve COVID-19 relief funds without further delay. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The yield on the 10-year Treasury was steady at 0.94% on Thursday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 5 cents to $45.32 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Koca said in a statement late Wednesday that the first shipment of the inactivated vaccine will arrive in Turkey after Dec. 11.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Inactivated vaccines are made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it. Safely brewing and then killing the virus can take longer than newer technologies. But inactivated vaccines give the body a sneak peek at the germ itself rather than just the single spike protein, which mediates the entry of the coronavirus.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The minister said early use authorization would be granted after Turkish labs confirm vaccine safety and initial results from Phase 3 trials are assessed. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If developments continue positively as we expect, Turkey would be among the first countries in the world to begin vaccinations in the early phase,” Koca said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In November, The Lancet published a study about the efficacy of Sinovac’s vaccine candidate based on initial Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. The study said the efficacy was determined to be moderate, and that the vaccine produced lower levels of antibodies than those that have been found in recovered COVID-19 patients. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The protective efficacy of CoronaVac remains to be determined,” the study said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Candidates from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have said that they have more than 90% efficacy rates. The U.K.’s AstraZeneca have an efficacy rate of 70-90%, again based on limited clinical trials.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Vaccination efforts would be rolled out in four stages, the minister said. The first group includes health care workers, citizens above age 65, and people living in homes for the elderly, disabled or other protective care homes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Next would be essential workers and people above 50 with at least one chronic disease. Third, people younger than 50 with at least one chronic illness, young adults and other workers would be vaccinated. The fourth and final phase would be for the rest of the population.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The CoronaVac will be delivered in two doses per person. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday the vaccine would be administered free of charge. Other COVID-19 vaccines would be sold at pharmacies, according to the health minister.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We will take delivery of at least 10 million doses of the vaccine in December and likely 20 million. Another 20 million doses in January and 10 million in February,” Koca said earlier this week. Turkey's population is more than 83 million. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Koca had previously announced an agreement for 1 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be delivered in December. He said Wednesday that negotiations were ongoing for more vaccines that introduce a so-called messenger RNA, or mRNA, sequence coded for a disease specific antigen, which prompts the body to have an immune response.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;RNA vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence (the molecule which tells cells what to build) which is coded for a disease specific antigen, once produced within the body, the antigen is recognized by the immune system, preparing it to fight the real thing.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Turkey was included in the trial phases of both vaccines and is also developing a local vaccine. Vaccine trials usually take years but have been drastically sped-up in wake of the global pandemic. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Turkey has reported record fatalities for 10 consecutive days, with 193 new deaths Wednesday, bringing the total death toll in the country to 14,129.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The daily number of infections has also hit a record high of 31,923, as Turkey resumed reporting all positive cases last week after four months of only releasing the numbers of symptomatic patients. The new daily infection numbers put Turkey among the worst-hit in the world.

the Chicago Cubs after helping the team win its first World Series title in more than a century, among 59 players who became free agents as part of the fallout from the coranavirus pandemic when their

.188 with 11 homers in 59 games, down from 38 homers, 92 RBIs and a .250 batting average in 155 games in 2019. Almora batted .167 in 28 games last season and earned $1,667,667 prorated from $4.5 million, down from a .236 average, 12 homers and 32 RBIs in 2019.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Schwarber returned from a serious knee injury and hit .412 with two RBIs in the 2016 World Series as the Cubs won their first championship since 1908. He served as the designated hitter for games in Cleveland. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Almora made a key play in Game 7, running for Schwarber in the 10th inning, advancing on Kris Bryant’s fly ball and scoring the go-ahead run on Ben Zobrist’s double in an 8-7 victory.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Just 137 players remained eligible to exchange salary arbitration numbers with their teams on Jan. 15, down from 155 on the eve of the deadline last January.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While the total number of players let go at the deadline was up only a bit from 56 last year, more high-quality players were set free by teams, many trying to cut expenses after a regular season that included a sharp revenue drop because no fans were allowed in stadiums due to health conditions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Milwaukee was on the verge of cutting hard-throwing reliever Corey Knebel but instead traded the right-hander to the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named or cash just ahead of the deadline. Knebel was an All-Star in 2017 with 39 saves and 126 strikeouts in 76 innings but missed 2019 following Tommy John surgery and struck out 15 in 13 1/3 innings in the pandemic-shortened season as his average fastball velocity dropped 3 mph to just under 95 mph.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Fifty-nine players agreed to one-year contracts ahead of the deadline, many of them facing a threat of being cut.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Minnesota reached deals with five players, including pitcher José Berríos ($500,000 signing bonus plus $5.6 million salary) and center fielder Byron Buxton ($5,125,000).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Kansas City agreed with designated hitter Jorge Soler ($8.05 million), first baseman Hunter Dozier ($2.72 million), right-handers Jesse Hahn ($1.75 million) and Jakob Junis ($1.7 million), and outfielder Franchy Cordero ($800,000).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The New York Mets agreed to a $5.2 million, one-year deal with left-hander Steven Matz and finalized their $15.5 million, two-year contract with free-agent reliever Trevor May, a deal that had been pending a physical. The Mets allowed pitchers Chasen Shreve, Nick Tropeano, Paul Sewald and Ariel Jurado to go free; Tropeano was claimed off waivers from Pittsburgh in October, before owner Steve Cohen bought the team from the Wilpon and Katz families.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;First baseman Matt Olson and Oakland agreed to a $5 million, one-year contract, and first baseman Jesús Aguilar and Miami agreed to a $4.35 million, one-year deal.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Boston agreed with pitcher Matt Barnes ($4.5 million) and catcher Kevin Plawecki ($1.6 million). Philadelphia agreed with pitchers Hector Neris ($5 million, down from the $7,111,111 option the Phillies declined in October) and Zach Elfin ($4.45 million).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Atlanta reached agreements with right-hander Luke Jackson ($1.9 million), infielder Johan Camargo ($1.36 million) and left-hander Grant Dayton ($900,000). and Milwaukee struck deals with catcher Omar Narváez ($2.5 million) and shortstop Orlando Arcia ($2 million).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The New York Yankees and right-hander Luis Cessa agreed at $1 million.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":2,"shortId":"5fff7f12c0a5ab243d41ed4a00823891","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/5fff7f12c0a5ab243d41ed4a00823891","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"nlcentral":{"isPr":null,"name":"nl central","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"MLB":{"isPr":null,"name":"MLB","canonicalName":"mlb","order":0},"chicagocubs":{"isPr":null,"name":"chicago cubs","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"nationalleague":{"isPr":null,"name":"national league","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 08:56:36","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"NEW YORK (AP) — Kyle Schwarber and Albert Almora Jr. were cut loose by the Chicago Cubs after helping the team win its first World Series title in more than a century, among 59 players who became...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:5fff7f12c0a5ab243d41ed4a00823891","media":[],"disableConnatix":false,"hons":false,"headlinePlacement":null,"revision":null,"videoContext":null,"description":null,"embargoDate":null,"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:7489790266"],"omitFromFeed":false,"sponsored":false,"storyLayout":null,"tagIds":["MLB","KyleSchwarber","Cincinnati","NewYork","AlbertAlmora","Coronaviruspandemic","apf-sports","EddieRosario","AdamDuvall","ChicagoCubs","ArchieBradley","DavidDahl"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By RONALD BLUM","leadPhotoId":"45dbb4ccc3854cec85b235ac600a9390"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","omitFromFeed":false,"isFullScreen":false,"topLineColor":null,"sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"endDateTime":null,"notificationTypeId":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"height":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hideDate":false,"virtual":true,"poll_key":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"archived":false,"localMemberName":null,"ignoreAlertMedia":false,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"pollFilters":{},"shortId":"b5c3d8a8121cbf19970787a162b8d916","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"sound":null,"disclaimerText":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"xxUpdated":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"hubPositions":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"customLayoutType":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"teams":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:b5c3d8a8121cbf19970787a162b8d916","pollId":null,"hideOtherTeams":false,"displayPositionHome":null,"contents":[{"block_fundamentals":true,"embedHeight":null,"stackedStory":false,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["6b3d269b3edf457d9016ceadbaa12d1d","28b01aa7564d4a78bafca159efa6f520","2d3d0dd66ee04afa98f18bc15b20b7a2","0f00b91da83e4b7a9e1079ffcea28f53","ede168e6a7264b8f89a8fc316eb9b774","fbedaf18180640bfafa61d3639bd7c0e","1099430b807f4e7683170b6537f72a6d","2a30f2f129cb4eb4bf28b392a3adf25c","3b5e5f22946c4d2abced8a2c455ee5ab"],"old_lead_video_key":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"title":"Virus Outbreak-The Latest","headline":"The Latest: Young S.

the early days in Wuhan, the first city first struck by the virus, getting a COVID test was so difficult that residents compared it to winning the lottery.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Throughout the Chinese city in January, thousands of people waited in hours-long lines for hospitals, sometimes next to corpses lying in hallways. But most couldn’t get the test they needed to be admitted as patients. And for the few who did, the tests were often faulty, resulting in false negatives.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The widespread test shortages and problems at a time when the virus could have been slowed were caused largely by secrecy and cronyism at China’s top disease control agency, an Associated Press investigation has found. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The flawed testing system prevented scientists and officials from seeing how fast the virus was spreading — another way China fumbled its early response to the virus. Earlier AP reporting showed how top Chinese leaders \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9\"&gt;delayed warning the public\u003c/a&gt; and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/3c061794970661042b18d5aeaaed9fae\"&gt;withheld information from the World Health Organization\u003c/a&gt;, supplying the most comprehensive picture yet of China’s initial missteps. Taken together, these mistakes in January facilitated the virus' spread through Wuhan and across the world undetected, in a pandemic that has now sickened more than 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, the reporting found. The deals took place within a culture of backdoor connections that quietly flourished in an underfunded public health system, according to the investigation, which was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails obtained by the AP.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Shanghai companies — GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB ($146,600) each, the sources said. It’s unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. In a departure from past practice for at least two epidemics, the NHC told Wuhan hospitals to send virus samples — from which tests can be developed — only to labs under its authority. It also made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated, and endorsed only test kits made by the Shanghai companies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;These measures contributed to not a single new case being reported by Chinese authorities between Jan. 5 and 17, even though retrospective infection data shows that hundreds were infected. The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public, barring large gatherings and curbing travel. One study estimates that intervention two weeks earlier could have \u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2293-x\"&gt;reduced the number of cases by 86 percent\u003c/a&gt;, although it's uncertain whether earlier action could have halted the spread of the virus worldwide. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When tests from the three companies arrived, many didn’t work properly, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With few and faulty kits, only one in 19 infected people in Wuhan was tested and found positive as of Jan. 31, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-02-10-COVID19-Report-4.pdf\"&gt;an estimate by Imperial College London\u003c/a&gt;. Others without tests or with false negatives were sent back home, where they could spread the virus. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Days after he first started coughing on Jan. 23rd, Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher, waited in an eight-hour line at a Wuhan hospital. A CT scan showed signs of viral infection in both his lungs, but he couldn’t get the test he needed to be hospitalized.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When Peng finally got a test on Jan. 30, it turned out negative. But his fever wouldn’t drop, and his family begged officials for another test.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There were very, very few tests, basically none….if you couldn’t prove you were positive, you couldn’t get admitted to a hospital,” his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. “The doctor said there was nothing that could be done.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing, which varied widely from nation to nation. Germany, for example, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/78f7c6b4555a28e64dc96d395366290e\"&gt;developed a test \u003c/a&gt; that became the World Health Organization gold standard days after the Chinese government released genetic sequences on Jan. 12. But in the U.S., the CDC declined to use the WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/c335958b1f8f6a37b19b421bc7759722\"&gt;led to even longer delays than in China.\u003c/a&gt;\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other countries also had the benefit of learning from China’s experience. But China was grappling with a new pathogen, and it wasn’t yet clear how bad the pandemic would be or how many tests would be needed.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It was very early,” said Jane Duckett, a professor at the University of Glasgow examining the Chinese government’s response to the coronavirus. She said the government was “just trying to figure it out.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, the hiccups and delays in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China’s foreign ministry and China’s top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We did a brilliant job, we worked so hard,” said Gao Fu, the head of China CDC, in a videoconference in July. “Unluckily, unfortunately, this virus we are facing, it’s so special.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;__________\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;None of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits for the biggest pandemic in a century were well-known in the industry. For one engineer from a Wuhan-based diagnostics firm, the Shanghai competitors popped out of nowhere “like bamboo shoots” – all the more so because his company had the factories and expertise to produce testing kits in the city where the virus was first detected.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We were surprised, it was very strange,” the engineer said, declining to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. “We hadn’t heard about it at all, and then suddenly there’s test kits from certain companies you have to use, and you can’t use ones from anyone else?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BioGerm was officially founded just over three years ago in a conference room, where the CEO mulled how to survive in a small and crowded market for test kits. GeneoDx had fewer than 100 employees, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese corporate records database – compared to competitors that employ hundreds or even thousands of staff.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But what the companies lacked in resources or experience, they made up for in connections.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Company posts, along with hundreds of internal emails and documents obtained by The Associated Press, show extensive ties between the three companies and top China CDC researchers in Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese regulators barred AP attempts to obtain credit reports on the companies, saying they were classified as “confidential enterprises” during the outbreak. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Despite China’s efforts over the years to reform public health and push for open bidding in a competitive marketplace, medical companies still cultivate personal relationships with officials to secure deals, according to seven executives from different competitors. Under President Xi Jinping, China has cracked down on corruption, but industry insiders say a lack of firm boundaries between public and private in China’s health system can create opportunities for graft.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Even amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, “there is no excuse for the flow of cash from these companies to the CDC,” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chinese bribery laws also state that any financial transaction has to be recorded and documented clearly. The AP was unable to ascertain whether the agreements between the CDC and the Shanghai companies were documented, but a CDC employee with access to some of the agency’s finances said there was no record of them. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Despite the questions around bribery, other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200220162408/http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/wxzl/2002-07/10/content_297298.htm\"&gt;special laws on the procurement of emergency goods\u003c/a&gt; during major natural disasters. The Chinese government is \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200420081103/http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2016-12/19/content_5150090.htm\"&gt;pushing to cultivate domestic companies\u003c/a&gt; focused on emergency response technologies, including test kits, to protect its national interest.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,” said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. “Anything affecting the national interest can be deemed to be of utmost importance for special regulations... I wouldn’t be so quick to rush to judgement.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China CDC guidelines state that \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201124142048/http://www.nhc.gov.cn/ewebeditor/uploadfile/2015/11/20151106103321705.docx\"&gt;the agency is responsible for maintaining a reserve of testing chemicals to screen for rare pathogens\u003c/a&gt;, but do not specify how to procure them. An AP search of CDC procurement bids did not turn up any records, even though \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201201112435/https://www.whcdc.org/view/6713.html\"&gt;some other emergency procurements\u003c/a&gt; were publicly documented.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The China CDC has about a sixth the staff of its separate American equivalent, and they often earn far lower wages than in the private sector. So many employees from the China CDC have departed for private sector jobs over the past decade, draining its labs of talent.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among those who left was BioGerm’s founder, Zhao Baihui, the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC’s microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm’s predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars’ worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary even as she herself was at times in charge of purchasing, internal emails, records and contracts obtained by the AP show. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao spearheaded lucrative contracts with government officials – such as one worth 400,000 RMB ($60,000) with Shanghai customs officials where her husband worked, and another worth 55,500 RMB ($8,400) with CDC officials in Shanghai’s Pudong district, the emails and contracts show. Zhao declined to speak when reached by phone, and did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China’s cabinet. Before the outbreak, GeneoDx largely imported kits and acquired foreign technology to expand its business rather than develop its own products, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200323151619/http://www.geneodx.com/company_1_1.html\"&gt;according to company posts\u003c/a&gt; and a China CDC employee familiar with its operations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054822/http://www.chinaivdc.cn/xwdt/201910/t20191024_206446.html\"&gt;CDC training conference\u003c/a&gt; on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits, according to an internal document the AP obtained. In November, the company won \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201201071129/http://www.ccgp.gov.cn/cggg/zygg/cjgg/201911/t20191127_13431715.htm\"&gt;a contract to sell 900,000 RMB ($137,000) worth of test kits\u003c/a&gt; to Tan’s institute. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Also in attendance at the invitation-only event was BioGerm, as well as other companies that used the conference to promote their products, blurring the line between the government and the private sector. China CDC staff were invited to join a BioGerm group on WeChat, a Chinese messaging application, which CEO Zhao later used to sell coronavirus test kits, according to a CDC employee and a screenshot seen by the AP. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. Its founder, Li Hui, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190612064729/http://www.huiruibio.com/admin/UploadFiles/ueditor/file/20150529/14328756176020582.pdf\"&gt;coauthored a paper with Tan\u003c/a&gt; on coronavirus tests in 2012 and “jointly developed” \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200804120109/http://huiruibio.com/news.asp?id=14\"&gt;a test kit for the MERS outbreak\u003c/a&gt; in 2015 with Tan’s institute.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In an interview, CEO Li said the CDC routinely contracted with his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He said Tan’s lab at the China CDC had contacted him on Jan. 4 or 5 to make testing chemicals for the coronavirus based on CDC designs. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’ve been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it’s normal,” Li said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Their connections situated the three little-known companies in prime position in January, when a then-unknown pathogen was about to sweep the country and the world and change their fortunes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;_________\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the past, such as with H7N9 in 2013, the China CDC sent test designs to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. It also shipped along the chemical compounds needed – in effect the ingredients – for hospitals and CDC branches to mix their own test kits as soon as possible.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At first it looked like the China CDC was using the same playbook this time. The CDC had found the genetic map, or genome, of the virus by Jan. 3. By the next day, under CDC official Tan, the Emergency Technology Center at its Institute for Viral Disease Control \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201027102643/http://www.ccdi.gov.cn/toutiao/202003/t20200308_213051.html\"&gt;had come up with test designs\u003c/a&gt;. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But this time, the government held back information about the genome and test designs. Instead, the China CDC finalized “technology transfer” agreements to give the test designs to the three Shanghai companies, according to four people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The CDC did not have the authority to altogether prevent other scientists with competing agencies and companies from getting samples through back door routes and coming up with their own test recipes. But it tried to stymie such efforts and stop testing from being carried out. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;For example, Dr. Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, obtained patient samples on her own, found the genome from them and came up with a test by Jan. 3, according to a slideshow presentation she gave in March. But her lab fell under the jurisdiction of a competing agency to the CDC, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. The CDC barred her from obtaining more samples and testing for cases.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There’s no open collaboration mechanism,” said a public health expert who often works with the China CDC, declining to be named for fear of damaging relations there. “Everyone wants their turf.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. Otherwise, the cases would not be counted in the national coronavirus tally. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It was absolutely abnormal,” said a CDC lab technician, who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution. “They were totally trying to make it harder for us to report any confirmed cases.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In secret evaluations of test kits on Jan. 10, the CDC also approved only those from the three Shanghai companies, according to internal plans and instructions obtained by the AP. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Chinese government finally made its genomes public on Jan. 12, a day after another team published one without authorization. That opened the door for more companies to make their own test kits. However, China’s top health agency, the National Health Commission, still urged medical staff to buy the test kits from Huirui, BioGerm and GeneoDx that the CDC had validated, according to internal instructions obtained by the AP. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The evaluations and selections of test kits were conducted with the knowledge and direction of China’s top health official, Ma Xiaowei, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200527190625/http://www.chinacdc.cn/gsywlswxx/bdbs/202001/t20200114_211189.html\"&gt;according to a CDC post on Jan. 13\u003c/a&gt;. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Jan. 14, Ma held an internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, as AP earlier reported. After that, China’s health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. BioGerm began taking orders from provincial CDC staff across the country on WeChat, a Chinese social media application.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’ve been entrusted by the national CDC to issue kits for you,” Zhao said, according to a screenshot of one of the group chats obtained by The Associated Press.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Quick! Give me, give me,” said one staffer in the Sichuan CDC.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the kits from GeneoDx kept showing inconclusive results, the CDC technician told the AP, and eventually her superior ordered her to toss them aside. The kits from Huirui were also unreliable, and the only ones that worked consistently were from BioGerm, she said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The quality was not good. Bad, poor quality,” said a public health expert familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified to avoid damaging ties with the China CDC. “But because they had a collaboration with the (CDC) Institute for Viral Disease Control and… they paid a million yuan, they were on the list.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BioGerm’s test kits were more dependable in part because they used chemicals from Invitrogen, a subsidiary of U.S. biotech giant Thermo Fisher. Huirui and GeneoDx used their own mixes instead, with more unreliable results. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Much larger competitors, including Chinese genetics giant BGI and Tianlong, developed their own kits in January, which were later found to be more effective than those made by the Shanghai companies. But those test kits weren’t endorsed by the China CDC. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“No test protocol, no primers and probes, then of course there’s no way to confirm cases,” said another China CDC employee who declined to be identified for fear of retribution. “And then, all of a sudden, you tell all the CDCs: purchase from these companies, now go for it. Then – chaos and shortage. Valuable time wasted.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chen Weijun, BGI’s chief infectious disease scientist, also said the early products recommended by the China CDC had “quality problems.” When asked why the China CDC selected the three Shanghai companies, Chen demurred.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You better ask the CDC this question,” said Chen, who collaborated with CDC researchers to publish \u003ca href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30251-8/fulltext\"&gt;the first paper on the virus\u003c/a&gt;. “But actually, everyone understands what’s going on, why this happened, right? You can reach your own conclusions, right?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;_______________\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again. But test kits were scarce. Some other cities in the same province \u003ca href=\"https://weekly.caixin.com/2020-02-15/101515683.html\"&gt;didn’t get kits until Jan. 22\u003c/a&gt;, and even those were often flawed. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Samples from 213 patients in February using GeneoDx tests suggested a false-negative rate of over 30 percent, \u003ca href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021493v2.full.pdf+html\"&gt;a study by Shenzhen doctors found\u003c/a&gt;. A March clinical trial report showed that among the test kits certified at the time, GeneoDx was the worst performer, followed by BioGerm. In general, the rate of false negatives for COVID tests varies widely, from 2% to more than 37%. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Philippe Klein, a French doctor who treated foreign patients in Wuhan during the outbreak, estimated that about 20 percent of the tests turned up false negatives. Still, he said, delays in producing accurate tests kits are natural at the start of an outbreak.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The Chinese did a lot in a short time,” Klein said. “It was a new test, so in the beginning, there was a lack of tests, of course.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Jan. 22, the National Health Commission quietly removed the names of the three Shanghai companies from \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200826030307/http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202001/c67cfe29ecf1470e8c7fc47d3b751e88.shtml\"&gt;its coronavirus guide\u003c/a&gt; as preferred distributors. After the Chinese government ordered Wuhan shut down on Jan. 23, the three companies faced massive logistical hurdles to getting their tests in.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Jan. 26, officials set up a fast-track “green channel” for companies to get their test kits approved. The National Medical Products Administration approved test kits from seven companies, including BioGerm and GeneoDx but not Huirui. Li, Huirui’s CEO, said it was because his company was inexperienced in obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial tests. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But it took time for other companies to ramp up production and ship tests in, leaving Wuhan struggling to meet demand into early February and depriving many residents of treatment. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Peng died on Feb. 19.

It's worked in their favor.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It opened the door,” Chadwell said. “It opened the door because of one, not having a lot of games early on, I should say, leagues waiting until late to play. So it gave us an opportunity, one, to get on TV. It gave us an opportunity, two, to start playing and our name getting out there. Both programs we’ve taken advantage of it. We won.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It wouldn’t matter if we weren’t winning. But we had a door, we had an opportunity to open it and we’ve kicked it down to take advantage of it.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Both programs are relative new comers to the Football Bowl Subdivision. The Flames are in just their second full FBS season; the Chanticleers (9-0) made the step up in 2017.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They seem to be enjoying the national attention.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Liberty has beaten Syracuse and Virginia Tech, both of the Atlantic Coast Conference, on the ACC Newtork. They came up one point shy in a 15-14 loss to North Carolina State two weeks ago, and fell out of the Top 25 — albeit not for long.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’ve had a year of just tremendous exposure,” Liberty athletic director Ian McCaw said Wednesday. “We’ve made strides beyond what we could have imagined.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's hard for most college football fans to imagine this improbable Top 25 showdown.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The matchup renews an old rivalry from when both teams played in the Big South, often squaring off to determine the champion. It only came together this summer when both programs found themselves needing to replace a a school on their respective schedules.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Freeze has heard some of the stories about the series, with each team winning seven times. But that's history, and Freeze is looking to create new records. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I don’t need this to be a rival game to get my juices flowing. It’s a Top 25 matchup, a chance for us to win 10 games. I’ll be very disappointed if our kids let this get to their emotions to where they’re not poised,” he said. “After about two minutes, when you get hit right in the face, all of that kinda just subsides and you might ought to worry about executing on the given play and the game plan.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Flames have spent four weeks in the rankings, climbing as high as No. 21 before losing to the Wolfpack. The Chanticleers have been in the poll for seven weeks.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Each week we have moments that surpass the next one,\" said fifth-year Coastal Carolina senior linebacker Silas Kelly. \"It’s been a historic year for our team and our program. There are so many throughout the year. I think the most memorable part for me when I’m looking back on the 2020 season is how we all came together, worked hard together and decided we weren’t going to listen to outside noise and let that affect us.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Chanticleers' marquee victories came early as they beat Kansas 38-23 to start the season and No. 20 Louisiana-Lafayette 30-27 in mid-October. The Flames' victories against the Orange and the Hokies were their first ever against ACC teams, and Freeze hopes the experience of preparing for those contests will carry over this week.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Said Freeze, “There’s no teacher like experience.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___ \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;AP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this

Santas conducting in-person visits are using some combination of masks, the outdoors, barriers and distance for safety. Others are doing virtual visits, where children chat with Santa online for prices typically ranging from $20 to $100, depending on the length and extras, such as whether customers want a recording. Some Santas are taking the season off. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv id='2c0c699c86fe494796878afe7f0b889f' class='media-placeholder'&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Santa safety is our No. 1 concern” and negotiated into every contract, said Mitch Allen, president of HireSanta, one of the nation's largest agencies. He said the pandemic initially dried up his business, but it bounced back, especially online. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The average Santa makes $5,000 to $10,000 during a normal season, Allen said. That's a welcome bonus for men often retired on a fixed income, but many Santas say revenue is down as corporate parties and other lucrative gigs evaporated. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Jac Grimes, a Santa in Greensboro, North Carolina, gave up home visits, about a third of his business. He did it not just for his own health, but to prevent becoming a superspreader, fearing he'd pass the virus from one family to the next. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At a farmers market he annually works, Grimes and his wife dress up as Santa and Mrs. Claus and sit in a parking lot where they to talk to people who remain inside their cars. Some homeowners associations are moving their annual Santa-visitation parties outdoors; Grimes will arrive in his red convertible to greet the crowds from afar.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;One of the hardest adjustments Santas have made is wearing masks that hide their painstakingly grown beards.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Santa performers are fairly vain people — if they are good,” Grimes said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The virus has many Santas and parents turning to virtual visits, which are booked through each Santa's personal website or agencies like Allen's. That often has Santas turning to their children and others for help mastering the computer skills needed. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It has been a challenge,” said Christopher Saunders, a Santa performer in Tool, Texas, a small town near Dallas. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But Saunders and others say virtual sessions are a good if imperfect substitute for in-person visits. Parents fill out questionnaires, allowing performers to personalize their patter, and a side benefit is that the sessions aren't rushed. Many Santa mall visits last no more than two minutes to keep the line moving. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You get a different energy,” Saunders said of the virtual visits. “You can see the child’s expressions, as pure as they are.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Jim Beidel, a Santa performer near Seattle, said knowing the children's personal stories, such as their friends and school, helps Santas sell their Christmas magic. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It really enhances the engagement, the suspension of disbelief, especially among the older children,\" he said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But even Santas with the best gigs are hurting. Howard Graham usually portrays Santa in the grand foyer of New York's Radio City Music Hall during its Christmas show featuring the Rockettes. That's gone, so he's doing virtual visits and five days with a historic railroad in Pennsylvania. Still, he's taking a financial and emotional hit. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I love what I do ... bringing them (children) a little bit of smiles and hope,” said Graham, who has played Santa at Radio City for eight years. “I am going to do what I can not to change that.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That was also Six's goal as he settled recently into Santa's throne for a three-hour shift at Miami's Bass Pro Shops. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As families sat in front of the plexiglass for photos, Six tilted his head so his face shield didn't reflect the camera's flash. He cheerfully waved children around the plexiglass so they could tell him their wish list, keeping them 6 feet (1.8 meters) back. As he wished them a Merry Christmas, an elf swooped in with disinfectant, wiping the plexiglass and bench before the next group sat. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Six said the arrangement is “a little easier physically on Santa's back because he doesn't have to pick anybody up, but it's not as enjoyable because Santa doesn't get the interaction he normally gets.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But for families, sitting with Santa, even if behind a shield, is a bit of normalcy in abnormal times. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Paul and Sarah Morris and their children, 5-year-old Theo and Sophy, 4, were among the first to visit Six that night. An Air Force family visiting from Hawaii, the Morrises cajoled their children into hugging for their photo. “Stop wiggling,” Theo said, scolding his sister before each sibling told Santa their Christmas wish. Sophy wanted candy; Theo, a remote control Ford Mustang. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is definitely different,\" Sarah Morris said of the setup, “but the kids are excited and that's what matters.” \u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":3,"shortId":"123d38a5cea88f11e13c2d8c9737d5ee","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/123d38a5cea88f11e13c2d8c9737d5ee","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:11:31","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"MIAMI (AP) — Brad Six becomes Santa Claus, pulling his black boots over his red pants in the office of a Miami outdoor supply company.

quarantine.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When he returned to the sideline Wednesday night, he found himself coaching in a vastly different atmosphere — and relying on a familiar script.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Adam Flagler scored 18 points, three of his teammates also reached double figures and Baylor used its trademark defense to turn the game and pull away from No. 5 Illinois for an 82-69 victory in the Jimmy V Classic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;To Drew, it felt like old times.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The last two games I thought our offense was further along than our defense,\" he said. “I think our defense has caught up more to where we were last year and you know you're going to need it to play like that every night to win games.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's bad news for the rest of college basketball, though.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Baylor (3-0) outrebounded the Fighting Illini 20-10 and forced twice as many turnovers as it committed in the second half while also outscoring Illinois in the paint and off the bench in the school's first non-conference top-five matchup.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And after an uncharacteristic first half, Drew understood why his players might have been a little unnerved.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’m not going to lie, I was really excited to be back,\" said Drew, who tested positive for COVID-19 three days before the scheduled season opener. “I missed the guys, I missed being part of the team and it was really exciting to be back.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He was also excited, like his players, to be playing on national television in Indianapolis.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the Bears did exactly what they needed to do. They drew fouls against Kofi Cockburn, turning him into a non-factor. And although Ayo Dosunmu led the Illini (3-1) with 18 points, he was just 6 of 18 from the field. Giorgi Beshanishvili finished with 15 points while filling in for Cockburn.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It was a frustrating night,\" Illinois coach Brad Underwood said. “It was a great opportunity to learn. I'm disappointed in our loose balls in the second half, but give credit to them.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The game also had a much more intense atmosphere than the previous two at Bankers Life Fieldhouse largely because of the raucous applause and loud cheers coming from the benches in what amounted to a draw for almost 30 minutes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Baylor forward Jonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua started the decisive stretch by making two free throws with 12:51 left. That broke a 43-all tie and spurred the Bears to six straight points. After Illinois made a 3-pointer, Baylor scored five more points and then took control with another run, this time 9-0.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;When it ended, Baylor led 65-51 with 7:31 left and the Illini never seriously challenged again.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BIG PICTURE\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Illinois: After last week's scare against Ohio, the Fighting Illini wanted to bounce back with a strong performance. Underwood's team certainly accomplished that much. It just didn't pull off the kind of signature win it envisioned — but that may be only a matter of time.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Baylor: While Gonzaga has proven itself a worthy No. 1, the Bears can say the same about being No. 2. They've won their first three this season. They have enough offensive firepower, defensive tenacity and experience to play with — and beat — anyone in the country.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;STAT PACK\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Illinois: Andre Curbelo scored 11 points and was the only other Illini player in double figures. ... Cockburn had seven points and four rebounds. ... Illinois was outscored 24-7 in second-chance points and 38-30 in the paint.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Baylor: Davion Mitchell had 15 points and seven assists, while Jared Butler scored 12. ... MaCio Teague added 11 points and Tchamwa Tchatchoua had nine points and nine rebounds.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THEY SAID IT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Illinois: “They fight like dogs for 40 minutes,\" Beshanishvili said. “When you make mistakes, even the littlest mistakes, they cost you a lot.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Baylor: “We kind of expected it,\" Mitchell said when asked about the contributions of Flagler and Tcahmwa Tchatchoua. “Those guys are in the gym more than anyone so we kind of expect that from those guys. It wasn’t really a surprise for us.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;UP NEXT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Illinois: Hosts UT-Martin on Saturday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Baylor: Prepares for Saturday's showdown in Indy

action from President Donald Trump in the coming weeks that could test the limits of presidential pardon power.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump is said to be considering a slew of pardons and commutations before he leaves office, including potentially members of his family, former aides and even himself. While it is not unusual for presidents to sign controversial pardons on their way out the door, Trump has made clear that he has no qualms about intervening in the cases of friends and allies whom he believes have been treated unfairly, including his former national security adviser, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pardon-michael-flynn-russia-aeef585b08ba6f2c763c8c37bfd678ed\"&gt;Michael Flynn\u003c/a&gt;.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The list of potential candidates is long and colorful: Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, imprisoned for financial crimes as part of the Russia investigation; George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, just like Flynn; Joseph Maldonado-Passage, aka “Joe Exotic,\" who starred in the the Netflix series “Tiger King”; and former contractors convicted in a Baghdad firefight that killed more than a dozen civilians, including women and children.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump, long worried about potential legal exposure after he leaves office, has expressed worry to confidants in recent weeks that he, his family or his business might be targeted by President-elect Joe Biden’s Justice Department, although Biden has made clear he won't be part of any such decisions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nonetheless, Trump has had informal conversations with allies about how he might be able to protect his family, though he has not taken any steps to do so. His adult children haven't requested pardons nor do they feel they need them, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private matters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump has also discussed potentially shielding himself, The New York Times first reported. In a video posted on Facebook on Wednesday, he made a glancing reference to his potential vulnerabilities.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Now I hear that these same people that failed to get me in Washington have sent every piece of information to New York so that they can try to get me there,” he said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The speculation prompted a slew of preemptive pushback from critics.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Typically if someone is being given a pardon it suggests they may have committed a crime. That’s not something I would want to have associated with my family,” said Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a frequent critic of Trump.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer decried the notion of the president asking staff whether he can issue preemptive pardons for himself, his family members and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, with whom Trump has discussed potential action.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There’s a simple answer: No. No, Mr. President, that would be a gross abuse of the presidential pardon authority,” Schumer said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Presidents enjoy expansive pardon powers when it comes to federal crimes. That includes granting clemency to people who have not yet been charged, as President Gerald Ford did in 1974 when he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But presidents cannot issue pardons for state crimes nor can they sidestep the law by pardoning people for crimes that have not yet occurred, according to legal experts. It remains unclear whether a president has the power to pardon himself. No one has tried.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A decades-old opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel suggests presidents cannot pardon themselves because it would require them to serve as judges in their own cases, but it also posits that a president could declare himself unable to serve, transfer power to his vice president and receive a pardon that way.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Presidents often make controversial grants of clemency to friends and donors as they leave office: Bill Clinton pardoned wealthy financier Marc Rich, and Ronald Reagan pardoned New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. But Trump’s position is notable given the sheer number of former aides and allies who have been imprisoned, indicted or are facing legal jeopardy. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They include Manafort, Manafort deputy Rick Gates, the president's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, his former chief strategist Steve Bannon and his former lawyer Michael Cohen. Stone and Flynn are among those Trump already has granted clemency.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In most administrations, 99% of those who receive pardons are people the public never hears of, while the remaining 1% receive 99% of the attention, said Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt. But Trump’s interest in celebrities and high-profile figures has thrown those percentages off-kilter.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You can see the appeal of the pardon power to someone like him,” Kalt said. “It’s the one thing where the president says it and it gets done. He doesn’t have to deal with the ‘deep state.’ He doesn’t have to go through congressional oversight or judicial review.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In previous administrations, pardons have gone through a formal review process at the Justice Department in which lawyers carefully examine cases before making recommendations to the White House. Trump has largely sidestepped that process — instead relying on a more haphazard approach that has favored candidates whose cases have resonated with him personally or that have been championed by celebrities like Kim Kardashian West. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As the results of last month's election have become clear, those seeking pardons before Trump leaves office have redoubled their efforts to garner White House attention, leaning on high-profile Washington lawyers, re-upping PR efforts and, in the case of Papadopoulos, writing a book, appearing on Fox News and speaking to news outlets.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I simply want the facts to get out about exactly what happened in my situation and for the American public to determine its logical conclusion. Which I hope is a pardon. I do not expect it, but I would be honored to accept one,” he told The Associated Press.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Giuliani, meanwhile, has spoken directly with the president about a pardon. The two men have had preliminary conversations about the topic, but it is unclear how serious those have been. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Beyond the bold-face names, however, are the regular people, behind bars, who have tried to make the case that they were unfairly sentenced or deserve a second chance.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"So many people are crying out for help,” said Alice Marie Johnson, who had been serving a life sentence without parole until Trump commuted her sentence in 2018 after her case was championed by Kardashian West. Since then, Trump has featured Johnson's story in a Super Bowl ad and pardoned her during this year's Republican National Convention.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Johnson, who has already successfully lobbied the president to take action on the cases of several other people, said she again met with Trump at the White House several weeks ago to present additional cases, all for people with “just incredible rehabilitation and incredible prison records.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Personally, I'm hoping to see people home before Christmas,” she said. \"Families around the country are praying for a Christmas miracle.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The White House did not respond to questions and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she’d “heard no mention of any pardons in any conversations I’ve had in the White House\" other than Flynn.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump has so far used his clemency power less often than any president in modern history, according to Justice Department data compiled by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/24/so-far-trump-has-granted-clemency-less-frequently-than-any-president-in-modern-history/\"&gt;Pew Research Center\u003c/a&gt;.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It shows he has granted clemency 44 times, less than any other president since at least William McKinley.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You've got over 13,000 petitions filed by all these people who followed the rules,” submitting applications, having people write letters on their behalf and waiting years for their cases to be processed, said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the University of St. Thomas. He has participated in several meetings at the White House during Trump's term as officials brainstormed potential changes to the formal clemency process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“For those people that should be free,\" he said, Trump's friends-and-family approach to pardons is \"a deep and real tragedy.\"\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":1,"shortId":"44d80c1da3f4b84722e37fe60e5da4a9","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/44d80c1da3f4b84722e37fe60e5da4a9","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"unitedstatesgovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"united

bipartisan COVID-19 relief effort and his top Capitol Hill allies cut their demands for a $2 trillion-plus measure by more than half in hopes of breaking a monthslong logjam and delivering much-sought aid as the tempestuous congressional session speeds to a close.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden said Wednesday the developing aid package \"wouldn’t be the answer, but it would be the immediate help for a lot of things.” He wants a relief bill to pass Congress now, with more aid to come next year. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden's remarks followed an announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer of New York in support of an almost $1 trillion approach as the “basis” for discussions. The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv id='b29d53a8be2d4986affb78cb6311e25d' class='media-placeholder'&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\" Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan “problem solvers\" coalition.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's another sign of urgency for additional COVID aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn't as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The new plan includes a liability shield for businesses and other organizations that have reopened their doors during the pandemic. It's the first time Pelosi and Schumer have shown a willingness to consider the idea, a top priority of McConnell, though there's been no discussion on the details, which are sure to be tricky.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;McConnell had dismissed the bipartisan offer on Tuesday, instead aiming to rally Republicans around the $550 billion GOP proposal. But McConnell himself endorsed a $1 trillion-or so plan this summer, only to encounter resistance from conservatives that prompted him to retrench. He has acknowledged that another infusion of aid to states and local governments, a key Pelosi demand, probably will pass eventually.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;McConnell wouldn't respond when asked about the Democratic statement. His top deputy, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said GOP leaders might agree to merging the bipartisan proposal with McConnell's bill.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I think there's still time, although it's short, to put a bill together,\" Thune said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Any relief package would be attached to a $1.4 trillion year-end spending bill required to avert a government shutdown next weekend. Talks on that measure are proceeding but if lawmakers should stumble, a temporary spending bill would be needed as a bridge into next year.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a split-the-difference solution to the protracted impasse, hoping to speed overdue help to a hurting nation before Congress adjourns for the holidays. It was a sign that some lawmakers reluctant to adjourn for the year without approving some pandemic aid.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Their proposal includes $228 billion to extend and upgrade “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses for a second round of relief to hard-hit businesses such as restaurants. It would revive a special jobless benefit, but at a reduced level of $300 per week rather than the $600 benefit enacted in March. State and local governments would receive $160 billion.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There's also $45 billion for transportation, including aid to transit systems and Amtrak; $82 billion to reopen schools and universities; and money for vaccines and health care providers, as well as for food stamps, rental assistance and the Postal Service.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The new effort follows a split-decision election that delivered the White House to Democrats and gave Republicans down-ballot success. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin struggled over a relief bill for weeks before the November election, discussing legislation of up to $2 trillion. Senate GOP conservatives opposed their efforts and Pelosi refused to yield on key points.\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":6,"shortId":"6f7c3d480b78670115a77738e9404803","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/6f7c3d480b78670115a77738e9404803","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"unitedstatesgovernment":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"united

(AP) — After four years of President Donald Trump serving as his own chief spokesperson and frequently peddling false information and conspiracy theories in the process, successor Joe Biden is pledging to return to a more traditional approach to communicating with Americans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Much of that work will fall to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-virus-outbreak-wilmington-72831a3a55f97e5f56db8240bd21134a\"&gt;Jen Psaki\u003c/a&gt;, Biden's pick for White House press secretary. She's a veteran communications staffer who has worked on many top Democratic campaigns and held leading roles under President Barack Obama, including deputy press secretary and White House communications director, as well as spokesperson for the State Department. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;She'll assume the role at a critical time, facing a public that's skeptical of messages from institutions and a press corps whose relationship with the White House has been highly strained during the Trump era. Psaki, who turned 42 on Tuesday, is well-known in Washington, but she's not a household name.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Yet.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This job becomes one of the most recognizable people representing both the administration and the government writ large,” said Robert Gibbs, a former Obama press secretary. “She’ll be recognized when she travels overseas. She’ll be recognized when she goes to the grocery store.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump went through four press secretaries and often preferred to engage directly with the electorate, tweeting at all hours or holding his own press briefings — especially at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Both the president and his media team were frequently at odds with White House reporters while routinely spreading falsehoods. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One of Trump's press secretaries, Stephanie Grisham, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/aa2a5aef66e99730fa9cd0b996381301\"&gt;never held a single briefing\u003c/a&gt; during her tenure. His most recent choice, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/a508c0f9c946e5d49c220c2ac880cb09\"&gt;Kayleigh McEnany\u003c/a&gt;, has used her sporadic briefings to scold reporters on their choice of questions, lecture them about the content of their stories, and reinforce baseless claims by the president. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden has promised to restore daily press briefings, and Psaki says she views the core of her new job as seeking to rebuild trust in government, especially during the pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s difficult to imagine now how different this is going to be in a couple of months,” said Stuart Stevens, chief strategist for Republican Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign when Psaki was press secretary for Obama’s reelection campaign. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Stevens, a fierce Trump critic, said that after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, White House communications staffers won’t be “graded upon their willingness to lie for the president.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Former Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough remembered Psaki once coming into his office and “pushing back quite strongly” on a policy point, seeking to get “answers that she knew she would be asked about.” He said the exchange simultaneously annoyed and impressed him.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“She was not a passive participant who was just taking messaging to pass along,” McDonough said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, simply returning to the way things were during the Obama administration is not something all journalists are looking forward to. While its relationship with the press was not as combative as the current administration's, the Obama White House tightly controlled access to information, was obstructionist on many Freedom of Information Act requests and offered aggressive spin on key events.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It also used the 1917 Espionage Act in \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/9d9a76067d5b47e5a290dc9832369c92\"&gt;unprecedented ways\u003c/a&gt;, prosecuting more people for leaking sensitive information to the public than all previous presidents combined.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Harold Holzer, a onetime congressional press secretary and author of the book “The Presidents and the Press,\" said many White House journalists “were horrified by their treatment in the Obama administration.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“They were being told to consult the White House website for answers to their questions, Obama never showed up ... unless it was to go give a cupcake on someone’s birthday, he didn’t answer FOIA requests,” Holzer said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Psaki has already led calls with reporters to discuss the progress of Biden's transition to the White House, though those haven't come daily. Biden, meanwhile, has held only two formal press conferences since Election Day. Trump went weeks after his victory in 2016 without convening a press conference, but his team did provide daily updates by phone to reporters. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Holzer noted that Biden “is friendly, but he’s guarded and he'll be more protective.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Presidential press corps combativeness long predates Trump and Obama. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;John Adams signed a sedition law prohibiting “malicious writing” about the president and executive branch. Abraham Lincoln imprisoned editors during the Civil War, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt admonished a journalist to go to the corner and wear a dunce cap. Early in Bill Clinton’s term, the corridor between the briefing room and the press secretary’s office was closed to journalists — causing an uproar among their ranks and a reversal of the policy.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s happened before. It’s just that it wasn’t on social media,” Holzer said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A native of Stamford, Connecticut, and a graduate of William &amp;amp; Mary, Psaki is part of an \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-politics-07688c9660af983116827225e0b3c5fb\"&gt;all-female senior communications team\u003c/a&gt; for the Biden White House. She declined an interview request through a Biden transition team spokesperson.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;McDonough recalled recruiting Psaki back to the White House from the State Department on the president’s behalf in 2015 — and her saying that she was having a family and that nothing would keep her from achieving that goal.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’ll never forget having that conversation with her and how insistent she was,” McDonough said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Psaki and her husband, Gregory Mecher, have two children, ages 2 and 5. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gibbs worked closely with Psaki in the Obama press office and said she has a good relationship with Biden and with reporters, excels at message planning and can be \"calm inside a building that, even on the best day of the administration, is a bit chaotic.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You get calls at 2 in the morning from the Situation Room, you’re up early reading news,” Gibbs said of the post Psaki is taking on. “You have to be ready to react to what you know is going to happen and what you have no idea’s going to happen. And that really doesn’t turn off from the moment you start the job until the moment you finish it.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Current and former colleagues say Psaki is careful to take care of those around her, even people she far outranks. A 2008 Obama communications intern recalled Psaki providing an air mattress to use for the summer after a housing mix-up.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden aides say that the president-elect decided on Psaki because she ran point for the Obama press office on the economy, especially stimulus spending — an issue that then-Vice President Biden, and the man he's tapped as his administration's first chief of staff, Ron Klain, were leading voices on. That’s important since Biden has promised to spend billions creating green jobs and making infrastructure improvements to better combat climate change and to reduce economic inequality while reviving the post-pandemic economy. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Psaki also has extensive foreign policy experience from her time at the State Department. That, combined with her White House years, makes her among the most practically experienced people to take on the role of press secretary while giving her deep knowledge of key issues, aides say. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Psaki is also remembered for some tense exchanges with journalists during State Department press briefings. Videos of some of those have now begun to resurface in Russia. State media there is often critical of U.S. political figures but in the past singled out Psaki, turning her last name into a verb, “Psaking,” meant to denote making mistakes while speaking publicly. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, Stevens, the Romney 2012 top strategist, said any media dust-ups will be grounded in a public and political reality that evaporated during the Trump era. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’m sure she’s going to have a lot of fights with reporters, and reporters are going to have frustrations. And that’s how it should be,” he said. “But they will be people living in the same universe. They’re not going to be debating about whether gravity’s a reasonable phenomenon.”

He ordered them reunited within 30 days.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The 628 children whose parents are still not accounted for were separated before the judge's order, going back to July 1, 2017, and were all released from federal custody before the June 2018 order. Children from that period are difficult to find because the government had inadequate tracking systems. They include hundreds separated during a trial run of the policy in El Paso, Texas, from July to November 2017 that was not publicly disclosed at the time.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President-elect Joe Biden seized on the issue during the final weeks of his campaign, promising a task force to help locate parents.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The ACLU wants Biden to allow separated families to return to the United States to be given “some kind of legal status,” Gelernt said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We think that’s only fair given what they’ve been put through,\" Gelernt said. \"We will find the families but we cannot provide the families with the right to return to the United States and give legal status.

taking samples of the moon’s surface and sealed them within the spacecraft for return to Earth, the first time such a mission has been attempted by any country in more than 40 years. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Chang’e 5, the third Chinese probe to land on the moon, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing’s space program, which also has a probe en route to Mars carrying a robot rover. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Chang’e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon’s near side, on a mission to return lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since 1976.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The probe “has completed sampling on the moon, and the samples have been sealed within the spacecraft,” the China National Space Administration said in a statement. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Plans call for the upper stage of the probe known as the ascender to be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth. The timing off its return was not immediately clear and the lander can last up to one moon day, or 14 Earth days, before plummeting temperatures would make it inoperable. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chang’e is equipped to both scoop samples from the surface and drill 2 meters (more than 6 feet) to retrieve materials that could provide clues into the history of the moon, Earth other planets and space features. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While retrieving samples is its main task, the lander is also equipped to extensively photograph the area surrounding its landing site, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chang'e 5's return module is supposed to touch down around the middle of December on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft have made their returns since China first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third country do so after Russia and the United States. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending a crewed mission to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;China also launched Its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While China is boosting cooperation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While

Nembhard and Corey Kispert each scored 19 points, and Suggs' return shifted the transition game into gear to help the Bulldogs rally past No. 11 West Virginia 87-82.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“At first, we were kind of disappointed because we all love Jalen,\" Nembhard said. “Him coming back in the game was big for us. He played football so you know he’s tough and we’re pretty versatile so we could do some different things in the second to help him out. It worked out well for us.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The freshman star finished with four points, five assists and six rebound — much of that production coming after he went down with what initially appeared to be a serious left ankle injury.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;By the second half, he was lobbying to get back on the court. And once he did, everything turned for Gonzaga, which struggled against the Mountaineers size and strength.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But once they were off and running, it was no match. Gonzaga (3-0) has won seven straight, dating to the end of last season, and already has two wins over top 15 opponents — Kansas and West Virginia (3-1).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Derek Culver finished with with 18 points and 15 rebounds and Oscar Tshiebwe had 14 points and nine rebounds before fouling out with 7:26 to play to lead the Mountaineers. Afterward, Culver blamed himself for this one.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We're every bit as good as they are — if we don't do dumb things,\" coach Bob Huggins said. “I think everyone should shoulder the blame.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;West Virginia's defense got Gonzaga out of sync early and when it looked like the Bulldogs were about to get going, Suggs drove toward the basket, his left foot sliding through the lane and collapsing to the floor where he stayed for several minutes. He needed help to reach his seat.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And the Mountaineers took advantage of the momentum shift by going on a 33-24lead late in the first half.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When Suggs returned in the second half, Gonzaga charged back.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It retook the lead on Kispert’s layup with 9:46 to play and seized control as Kispert and Ajayi combined for nine points in the decisive run.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BIG PICTURE\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;West Virginia: The Mountaineers weren't even supposed to be here — until a COVID-19 outbreak forced No. 13 Tennessee to back out. But Huggins' teams never back down from a challenge. They followed the same script Wednesday and nearly pulled a big upset.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gonzaga: It looks like the poll voters got this one right. The Bulldogs have opened this season with wins over two top 15 foes — Kansas and West Virginia — as well as Auburn, all on neutral courts. Yes, they can and must player better, but finding a way to win when things don't go according to script says a lot about where they are..\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;INJURY REPORT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Suggs was in pain from the moment he went down. He held a towel over his face and then continued to wince and writhe on the socially-distanced bench. Eventually, he stood up and walked gingerly to the locker room but did not return with what the team called an injured left ankle. Somehow, he made it back on the floor in the second as one of the catalysts of the comeback.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;West Virginia guard Sean McNeil also left during the first half after taking an elbow to the forehead. McNeil was called for a foul on the play as he tried to take a charge. He returned to action later in the first half — with four stitches.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THEY SAID IT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;West Virginia: “We’ve got a lot of work to do,\" Huggins said. “We did an extremely poor job of guarding ball screens. We fell asleep too many times. We made some careless errors that came back to bite us.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gonzaga: “Jaylen going down and the fact that they were throttling us on the glass and throttling our offense for a while,\" coach Mark Few said, explaining the obstacles his team had to overcome. “That’s basically how I think a lot of our games are going to go. I don’t think they're going to be a flowy as they were down in Florida.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;UP NEXT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;West Virginia: At Georgetown on Sunday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gonzaga: Vs.

(AP) — It was a rare sight after Los Angeles County restaurants were restricted to takeout to reduce the spread of the coronavirus: tables and chairs set up outside the Pie 'N Burger shop in Pasadena. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Owner Michael Osborn explained to two men who approached him Monday that the city famous for its Rose Parade had marched to its own beat and kept outdoor dining open.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“God bless Pasadena!” the two exclaimed, placing their order and taking a seat at one of the sidewalk tables, Osborn recounted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pasadena has become an island in the nation's most populous county, where a surge of COVID-19 cases last week led to a three-week end to outdoor dining and then a broader stay-home order that took effect Monday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The decision by Pasadena health authorities to buck Los Angeles County has been a relief to restaurateurs who have struggled to stay afloat amid closures, ever-changing rules and attempts to keep workers on the job and money in the till. Even Pasadena has made changes, mandating that only people in the same household can gather starting Wednesday, which applies to outdoor seating.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’re not out of the woods yet, but every day that goes by is a blessing that we can keep the outdoor dining open,” Osborn said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Infections and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County have been rising sharply in the past few weeks, hitting an all-time high Tuesday of more than 7,500 new confirmed cases and the rate of positive tests rising to 12% from 7% a week ago. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv id='abc0d74cf18544efb8da7aeffb8cb724' class='media-placeholder'&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The county's health order, which only allows restaurants to prepare food to go, applies to about 10 million residents except those in Pasadena or Long Beach — cities that have their own public health departments and can set their own rules. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Long Beach, a city of about 460,000, also closed outdoor dining. It implemented a stay-home order Wednesday, mostly mirroring the county's: urging people to stay inside as much as possible, further restricting store capacity and banning gatherings except for protests and religious services.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Closing dining at 31,000 county restaurants drew backlash from owners and some politicians who say there's no evidence eating outside is a big risk. Health officials counter that eating without a mask raises the threat of transmission.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Owners argue it will force more people to gather indoors, where the virus is known to spread easier and no one is enforcing rules.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;A divided LA County Board of Supervisors rejected a measure Nov. 24 that would have kept outdoor dining open. The Los Angeles City Council passed an urgent resolution last week asking the county to rescind the order, and Beverly Hills took similar action Tuesday. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti noted the pain restaurant employees face and on Wednesday announced a program to provide a one-time $800 stipend to some 4,000 food-service workers. Applications open next week.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Garcetti said 4 of every 10 food service employees have lost jobs this year. He said the initiative is “designed to deliver relief and a little peace of mind to some of our most vulnerable workers.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The California Restaurant Association took the county to court last week, arguing the county could provide no evidence that outdoor dining creates a greater risk of infection. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge, who did not block the ban last week, on Wednesday set a Dec. 8 hearing for the county to show evidence, attorney Dennis Ellis said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The winds of opinion have blown decidedly in our favor, with many people believing that the outdoor dining ban is overreaching,” Ellis said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pasadena, a city of 140,000 at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, has mostly followed the county's lead during the pandemic. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the home of the Rose Bowl and California Institute of Technology decided to chart its own course last week. Because it's smaller and can more closely monitor its 600 restaurants, officials said they chose more aggressive enforcement.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We literally have seen COVID cases in a large percentage of businesses across the city,” Pasadena spokeswoman Lisa Derderian said. “To single out restaurants was unfair.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said she couldn't predict whether Pasadena's decision would impact the county's infection rate. Given the city's size, it may be able to ensure safety measures are followed, she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But she noted that lack of compliance was not why dining shut down. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We are closing restaurants for outdoor dining for three weeks because people who are there are not able to wear their face coverings,” Ferrer said. “There’s much greater risk of transmission both to workers and to other people at your table and other people that are eating at the other tables.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Over the weekend, seven Pasadena restaurants were closed after inspectors found violations ranging from staff not wearing plastic shields over masks to seating people indoors, Derderian said. All had been approved to reopen after correcting errors.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Inspectors also shut down a car show, broke up birthday parties and soccer matches in parks, and warned people exercising to wear masks, she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;If the city doesn't stop outdoor dining altogether, it could be forced to by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who suggested Monday that a more “drastic” stay-home order could be in the works as the state tries to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At Lucky Baldwins, a pub in Pasadena's Old Town, business picked up Monday around happy hour. A patio that was expanded into an alley was about half full, and servers wore masks and face shields.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Anthony Angulo, who had driven from nearby Altadena to meet a friend, was glad he had an option to get a bite and some beers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“A lot of these business owners are struggling, and they don’t need to be hamstrung. They’re doing the best that they can,” he said. “Nobody is going inside standing shoulder to shoulder.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Owner Peggy Simonian said she was relieved Pasadena allowed two locations to stay open. She had to close a sister cafe in nearby Sierra Madre under the county order. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I feel stuck,” Simonian said. “I can’t move forward, can’t move backwards, can’t do anything. I can’t make this situation any better.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Melley reported from Los Angeles.\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":15,"shortId":"73786171dba573768de533c96ad16440","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/73786171dba573768de533c96ad16440","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 08:04:43","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"PASADENA, Calif.

General Assembly’s special session starting Thursday on the response to COVID-19 and the best path to recovery from the pandemic which has claimed 1.5 million lives, shattered economies, and left tens of millions of people unemployed in countries rich and poor.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Assembly President Volkan Bozkir said when he took the reins of the 193-member world body in September that it would have been better to hold the high-level meeting in June. Nonetheless, he said Wednesday it “provides a historic moment for us to come together to beat COVID-19.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“With news of multiple vaccines on the cusp of approval, and with trillions of dollars flowing into global recovery efforts, the international community has a unique opportunity to do this right,” he said. “The world is looking to the U.N. for leadership. This is a test for multilateralism.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When financial markets collapsed and the world faced its last great crisis in 2008, major powers worked together to restore the global economy, but the COVID-19 pandemic has been striking for the opposite response: no leader, no united action to stop the pandemic that has circled the globe.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sent a letter to leaders of the Group of 20, the world’s richest nations responsible for 80 percent of the global economy ahead of their summit in late March as COVID-19 was starting its killing spree urging that they adopt a “wartime” plan and cooperate on an international response to suppress the coronavirus. But there was no response.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The two-day special session will not be raising money to finance vaccine immunizations or taking any political action, and there will be no final declaration, just a summary document from Bozkir.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The real point of this special session is to galvanize concrete action to approach our response to COVID-19 in a multilateral and collective way,” General Assembly spokesman Brenden Varma said Wednesday. He added that there are currently many responses to the pandemic, but what’s needed now is to bring together all countries, U.N. actors, the private sector and vaccine developers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Leaders and ministers from over 140 countries will deliver pre-recorded speeches on Thursday after an in-person opening in the General Assembly including speeches by Bozkir and Guterres.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among the leaders slated to address the session are French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and European Union chief Charles Michel. The United States will be represented by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Friday’s session will focus on three virtrual panels, the first on the U.N.’s response to COVID-19 and the second on vaccines that will include representatives from producers BioNTech and Oxford University-AstraZeneca, and the World Health Organization’s ACT-Accelerator which is working to get vaccines to the world’s poorest people. The final panel is on recovery from COVID-19. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is expected to participate in all three panels.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Canada’s U.N. deputy ambassador Louise Blais, who organized the special session with Azerbaijan’s Ambassador Yashar Aliev, said it will be the first time that the U.N. system is bringing key players together to focus on COVID-19′s “myriad impacts.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Countries around the world are facing their own internal impacts, but it’s important that the U.N. continue to advocate ... that this crisis impacts us all and the solutions are global,” she told The Associated Press in an interview. “So, we have to work together in order to ensure that all of us get out of this, because until everyone does, no one is really safe.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Blais said the session is “an important step” and will focus on implementing the three resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on COVID-29, especially the wide-ranging measure approved in September. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The special session “comes at a critical time,” Blais noted, “because we now know that there are a number of vaccines that have proven to be effective.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Now, all eyes are on the critical distribution of vaccines,” she said, adding that this is expected to be a key them during the special session and it’s one “where the world is expecting us to work together and make sure that we have an equitable distribution of vaccine globally.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said secretary-general Guterres will be focusing on the need for all countries and people everywhere to have access to vaccines.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The vaccine needs to be treated as a `global public good’ and that will be the basis of the secretary-general’s message” on Thursday, Dujarric said.\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":0,"shortId":"99f2c14a490334169cc91638fb9080e0","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/99f2c14a490334169cc91638fb9080e0","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"unitednationsgeneralassembly":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"united nations general assembly","isPr":null,"order":0},"unitednations":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"united nations","isPr":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:41:49","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Nearly 100 world leaders and several dozen ministers are slated to speak at the U.N.

The Lakers are still finalizing their new contract with big man Anthony Davis, who is also represented by Paul.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James is getting the maximum deal to extend his tenure in Los Angeles, where he moved two seasons ago after his second stint with his hometown Cavaliers. Davis and James teamed up last season and won the Lakers' 17th championship in the bubble in central Florida.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James' previous contract ran through the upcoming season with a player option for 2021-22, allowing the third-leading scorer in league history to become a free agent next summer if he chose. Instead, James has committed to play through his 20th NBA season with the Lakers, where he moved in 2018 after title-winning tenures in Cleveland and Miami.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James turns 36 years old in four weeks, but the 16-time All-Star's level of play hasn't dipped even slightly after 17 seasons in the league. James averaged 25.3 points and led the NBA with 10.2 assists per game last season before winning the NBA Finals MVP award in October while beating the Miami Heat in six games.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Lakers are returning this winter with a roster that looks even better than last season's group on paper, with veterans Dennis Schröder, Montrezl Harrell, Marc Gasol and Wesley Matthews joining the rotation around James and Davis.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James will make more than $39 million this season, more than $41 million next season and more than $44 million in the final year of his new deal, during which he will turn 38.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Lakers have a history of rewarding superstars in their later seasons, allowing them to finish with the franchise rather than forcing Lakers icons to make difficult decisions about how they will wrap up their careers. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Magic Johnson, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Kobe Bryant all finished their Hall of Fame careers with the Lakers rather than making a late money-grabbing pit stop with another team.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Los Angeles famously gave a two-year, $48.5 million extension to Bryant when he was 35 years old in November 2013. The deal was criticized at the time for its largesse compared to Bryant's diminishing dominance, but owners Jeanie and Jim Buss felt the contract was an appropriate reward for Bryant's contributions to the franchise.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The new deal for James currently carries none of those concerns, because he is still a matchless player even after spending half of his life in the professional basketball and reaching nine of the last 10 NBA Finals while becoming the league's leading scorer in postseason history.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James has career averages of 27.1 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.4 assists over his 17 seasons, and he stayed close to those marks in points and rebounds last season despite becoming a 6-foot-9 point guard who won his first NBA assists title.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James and his family already appeared to be comfortable with a long-term future in Los Angeles. James is increasingly involved in media production in Hollywood, while his oldest son, Bronny, is on track to graduate from private Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth in 2023.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Davis is all but certain to re-sign with the Lakers this week, and the delay is widely interpreted as part of talks between Davis and the Lakers about the best way to keep the team in championship contention over the next few seasons. For instance, Davis could structure his deal to allow Los Angeles to pursue a third superstar in free agency next summer.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;James' agreement on an extension guarantees Davis will have an invaluable teammate for at least the next three seasons if Davis chooses to stay that long. James made remarkable alterations in his game last season to become a playmaker running the Lakers' offense and clearing space for Davis to excel.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":1,"shortId":"5b2cbe45a78ddd0fae54162a57c6bb04","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/5b2cbe45a78ddd0fae54162a57c6bb04","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"nbapacificdivision":{"isPr":null,"name":"nba pacific division","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"losangeleslakers":{"isPr":null,"name":"los angeles lakers","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"nationalbasketballassociation":{"isPr":null,"name":"national basketball association","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"nbawesternconference":{"isPr":null,"name":"nba western conference","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 08:56:36","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James has agreed to a two-year, $85 million contract extension through the 2022-23 season with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJames' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports,...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:5b2cbe45a78ddd0fae54162a57c6bb04","media":[],"disableConnatix":false,"hons":false,"headlinePlacement":null,"revision":null,"videoContext":null,"description":null,"embargoDate":null,"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:7501400197"],"omitFromFeed":false,"sponsored":false,"storyLayout":null,"tagIds":["LosAngeles","LosAngelesLakers","state-California","LeBronJames","Florida","apf-sports","AnthonyDavis","apf-Basketball","NBA"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By GREG BEACHAM","leadPhotoId":"4c900c4f87a14ec493713ea04cef78e9"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","omitFromFeed":false,"isFullScreen":false,"topLineColor":null,"sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"endDateTime":null,"notificationTypeId":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"height":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hideDate":false,"virtual":true,"poll_key":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"archived":false,"localMemberName":null,"ignoreAlertMedia":false,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"pollFilters":{},"shortId":"00231e30f720a999e4187c6600489108","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"sound":null,"disclaimerText":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"xxUpdated":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"hubPositions":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"customLayoutType":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"teams":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:00231e30f720a999e4187c6600489108","pollId":null,"hideOtherTeams":false,"displayPositionHome":null,"contents":[{"block_fundamentals":true,"embedHeight":null,"stackedStory":false,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["5a55ba3fc9244784bd8f07b78df68a96","fd056cb5408b42829f8855f6a7fbe94a","26a35fc4a0394c62bcd4f84450342b0c","35f864aa56844d0eaebe969899b46920"],"old_lead_video_key":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"title":"US-Virus Outbreak-California-Politicians Dining Out","headline":"Politicians eat own words after dining out, taking trips","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"00231e30f720a999e4187c6600489108_5a7aza0c0","latestEtag":null,"updated":"2020-12-03 03:01:00","contentType":"text","canonicalUrl":"san-francisco-coronavirus-pandemic-california-napa-gavin-newsom","embedRatio":null,"audioMediumIds":[],"layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"canonicalName":"lifestyle","order":3,"id":"apf-lifestyle","isPr":null,"name":"Lifestyle"},{"canonicalName":"us-news","order":7,"id":"apf-usnews","isPr":null,"name":"U.S. News"},{"canonicalName":"san-francisco","order":0,"id":"SanFrancisco","isPr":null,"name":"San Francisco"},{"canonicalName":"coronavirus-pandemic","order":0,"id":"Coronaviruspandemic","isPr":null,"name":"Coronavirus pandemic"},{"canonicalName":"california","order":0,"id":"California","isPr":null,"name":"California"},{"canonicalName":"napa","order":0,"id":"Napa","isPr":null,"name":"Napa"},{"canonicalName":"gavin-newsom","order":0,"id":"GavinNewsom","isPr":null,"name":"Gavin Newsom"},{"canonicalName":"restaurants","order":0,"id":"Restaurants","isPr":null,"name":"Restaurants"}],"disableNativo":false,"alertLinkDateTime":null,"embedCaption":null,"version":null,"leadVideoAutoEmbed":true,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:00231e30f720a999e4187c6600489108","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Their messaging has been clear: wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart, and most importantly: stay home!

\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But their actions aren’t living up to the rhetoric, creating a real political problem for some of the most vocal leaders in California’s fight to contain the coronavirus.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;First came Gov. Gavin Newsom, who won plaudits for issuing the first statewide stay-at-home order in the U.S. back in March. He broke the state rules when he and his wife were caught dining with 10 others at the posh French Laundry restaurant in Napa in early November with lobbyists and others from numerous different households, sitting close together, mask-less.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, was at the same $350-a-plate restaurant a day later, dining with a San Francisco socialite and six others. Breed has also won accolades for imposing some of the strictest rules in California, keeping coronavirus rates relatively low. Her spokespeople haven’t responded to queries about how many households were there — state rules cap those at three. Her spokesman rubbed salt in the wound by saying she has been trying to support local restaurants. The French Laundry is 60 miles (97 kilometers) out of town. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo on Tuesday fessed up to an outdoor Thanksgiving dinner at his parents’ home with people from five different households after tweeting that everyone should just stay home this Thanksgiving. And a Los Angeles County supervisor headed to dinner outside a restaurant hours after she voted against a measure that would have kept outdoor dining open, calling it “a most dangerous situation.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’re all really feeling the strain of this, but there is really that element of hypocrisy. So many who are struggling right now, and then you see them going to these very fancy social affairs and mixing with folks outside their immediate bubble,” said Melinda Jackson, a political science professor at San Jose State University.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other Democrats have also been caught flouting their own guidance. Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-coronavirus-pandemic-austin-texas-26340eabdc1d450e21ba650e42060f30\"&gt;forced to apologize Wednesday\u003c/a&gt; after a newspaper reported that he was in Mexico with family in November as he urged people to stay home amid worsening coronavirus caseloads, at one point recording a video during the trip in which he told residents back home that now was “not the time to relax.” The mayor of Denver, Michael Hancock, asked residents to “forgive decisions that are borne of my heart and not my head\" \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/travel-mississippi-media-social-media-coronavirus-pandemic-155ab9cc39de92424ec1ce486b32a338\"&gt;after traveling to Mississippi\u003c/a&gt; for Thanksgiving while he told others to stay home.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out what she called “Democrat hypocrisy\" Wednesday as she displayed images of the same politicians.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“These Democrats do not follow their own edicts. They act in a way that their own citizens are barred from acting,” she said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The revelations come at a critical time as the nation deals with a dramatic spike in case rates, hospitalizations and deaths. It’s more important than ever that we follow the rules, the public is told. But when the same leaders aren't following the guidelines themselves, their credibility is shattered and it makes it harder to trust that their guidance is solid.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Kim Elsbach, a professor of management at the University of California, Davis and Newberry chair in leadership, said consistency is critical to believing someone has integrity.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“One of the primary reasons people choose the leaders they do is because they believe they have ideals they can count on,” she said. “People are really stressed out by what they call uncertainty — not knowing what’s going to happen today, tomorrow or yesterday. When we choose leaders, we really want them to be consistent over time, especially in their values, their morals or their ideals.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The mea culpas have been across the board, or not at all.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Newsom quickly apologized, saying he “made a bad mistake” but noting the gathering was outdoors. Within days, photos emerged showing the group in a room that was enclosed on three sides with a sliding glass door on the other, maybe meeting the technical definition of outdoors, but perhaps not the spirit. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Breed’s dinner was apparently in the same kind of room, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, which her spokesman noted was allowed in Napa County at that time, though she shuttered indoor dining in her own city three days later. She never rescinded the pandemic rule of six people-per-table. But there has not been an apology. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Liccardo, in San Jose, apologized quickly and pledged “to do better.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While a spokesperson for LA County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl acknowledged her outdoor dinner, there was no “I’m sorry” either. And earlier in the pandemic, when surveillance cameras showed U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi getting a blowout when San Francisco hair salons were closed, she declined to apologize too, arguing she was set up by the conservative salon owner.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Experts said that acknowledging your mistake and apologizing quickly are key to moving on from a political crisis.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s better to just say ’I screwed up, it was dumb, I’m sorry, and it’s important that we follow these guidelines,' ” Elsbach said. “It only takes one event to lose that trust, that inconsistency, and it takes a long time to regain it.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;How can they move on in the midst of a crisis?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I would say to absolutely be on their best behavior from now on,\" Jackson said.

John Wall is moving to the Houston Rockets in a significant swap of point guards — one an MVP, the other a No. 1 overall draft pick — just weeks before the season starts.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Wizards shipped a future lottery-protected first round pick to the Rockets on Wednesday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Having the opportunity to acquire a player of Russell’s caliber and character was something that we could not pass up when looking at both the immediate and long-term future of our team,” Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard said in a release. “With that said, the decision to part ways with John, one of the greatest players in franchise history, was extremely difficult. What he has meant to our organization and our community is immeasurable and will not be forgotten.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;While Wall has played his entire professional career in the nation's capital, the move ends Westbrook’s tenure in Houston after just one disappointing season. He arrived from Oklahoma City in July 2019 for Chris Paul and draft picks.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Rockets had hoped that the 32-year-old Westbrook would be the final piece they needed to win their first title since winning back-to-back championships in 1994-95. But instead, Houston was eliminated from the playoffs by the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western semifinals. Westbrook was the 2017 NBA MVP and is a nine-time All-Star, but has failed to win a title.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many questioned whether the pairing of two ball-dominant guards like Westbrook and James Harden would work in Houston, but the longtime friends insisted that it would. After the Rockets were sent home from the playoffs early again, rumors started to swirl that the two weren't happy in Houston and both wanted out. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But after spending years building their entire team around Harden, who won MVP honors in 2018, the Rockets weren't interested in parting with him. This move could be new general manager Rafael Stone's way of appeasing Harden so the Rockets can continue their quest for a title this season instead of rebuilding without the superstar. Stone was promoted to GM last month after Daryl Morey stepped down before quickly taking a job with the Philadelphia 76ers. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Westbrook-Wall deal works under the NBA’s rules because the two players are owed about the same amount: Each gets more than $80 million over the next two seasons, plus each has a player option of more than $45 million for 2022-23.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And both were looking to move on.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wall, the No. 1 overall pick out of Kentucky in the 2010 draft, became the face of the franchise for Washington, a five-time All-Star who repeatedly helped get his team to the playoffs. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But Wall’s Wizards never reached 50 wins in a season or made it past the conference semifinals.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wall, who is 30, has averaged 19 points and 9.2 assists for his career.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He has been troubled by injuries of late, appearing in only 41 games in 2017-18 because of left knee surgery, then just 32 in 2018-19 because of a left heel problem that required an operation. While recovering from that, Wall tore his left Achilles tendon and sat out all of last season.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After a report surfaced that Wall wanted out of Washington, Sheppard said on Nov. 23 that Wall “didn’t request” to be moved when they spoke that morning.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There’s no plans to trade John,” Sheppard said during a video conference with reporters that day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He said he and Wall speak “pretty much every other day” and characterized their relationship as “very, very close.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There’s no issues with John and I,” Sheppard said then. “There’s no issues with John and the Wizards.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But he also reaffirmed that his plan is to build around shooting guard Bradley Beal, whose scoring average of 30.5 points last season was second in the league behind Harden.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After a stretch of getting to the postseason four times in five years, Washington has missed the playoffs each of the past two seasons, losing 47 games last season and 50 the season before.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hall of Famer Magic Johnson believes the pairing of Beal and Westbrook will be what the Wizards need to be a contender in the Eastern Conference. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Everyone now has to watch out for the Wizards! They traded for Russell Westbrook today,” Johnson tweeted. “(Westbrook)/(Beal)⁩ will terrorize the East and make the Wizards a playoff team.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wall was beloved in Washington and team owner Ted Leonsis lauded the player and his contributions to the team and city in a series of tweets Wednesday night. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He has been a great, all-star caliber player and a fantastic citizen and leader in our community,\" Leonsis wrote. “I am proud of how hard John has worked to come back to the league after two years away from competing. Our fans, our franchise and I will miss him very much.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;AP Sports Writer Howard Fendrich in Washington contributed to this

He was 89.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Benton-Banai died Monday at a care center in Hayward, Wisconsin, where he had been staying for months, according to family friend Dorene Day. Day said Benton-Banai had several health issues and had been hospitalized multiple times in recent years.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Benton-Banai, who is Anishinaabe Ojibwe, was born and raised on the Lac Courte Oreilles reservation in northern Wisconsin. He made a life of connecting American Indians with their spirituality and promoting sovereignty, and was the grand chief, or spiritual leader, of the Three Fires Midewiwin Lodge. Day said he was someone people looked to for guidance in the religious practice of the Anishinaabe Ojibwe people — and he gave countless babies their traditional names. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Benton-Banai’s place in the American Indian Movement, a grassroots group formed in 1968, can be traced to his launch of a cultural program in a Minnesota prison, said co-founder Clyde Bellecourt. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Bellecourt was in solitary confinement when he heard someone whistling “You are My Sunshine,\" and he looked through a tiny hole in his cell and saw Benton-Banai, a fellow inmate, recognizing him as an Indigenous man.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Bellecourt said Benton-Banai approached him about helping incarcerated Indigenous people, and they started the prison's cultural program to teach American Indians about their history and encourage them to learn a trade or seek higher education. Bellecourt said that Benton-Banai thought they could do the same work in the streets, and the program morphed into the American Indian Movement, an organization that persists today with various chapters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It started because I met Eddie in jail,” Bellecourt said. “Our whole Indian way of life came back because of him. … My whole life just changed. I started reading books about history of the Ojibwe nation… dreaming about how beautiful it must have been at one time in our history.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One of the group's first acts was to organize a patrol to monitor allegations of police harassment and brutality against Native Americans who had settled in Minneapolis where it's based. Members had cameras, asked police for badge numbers and monitored radio scanner traffic for mention of anyone who they might recognize as Indigenous to ensure their rights weren't being violated — similar to what the Black Panthers were doing at the time, said Kent Blansett, an associate professor of Indigenous studies at the University of Kansas who has written about the movement.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The group called out instances of cultural appropriation, provided job training, sought to improve housing and education for Indigenous people, provided legal assistance, spotlighted environmental injustice and questioned government policies that were seen as anti-Indigenous.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Anything they could find that they could insert a Native presence and voice, they were there to do,” said Blansett, a Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Shawnee and Potawatomi descendant.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At times, the American Indian Movement's tactics were militant, which led to splintering in the group. In one of its most well-known actions, the group took over Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in 1973 to protest U.S. and tribal governments. The 71-day occupation turned violent, and two people died in a shootout. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;As the movement broadened nationally, Benton-Banai kept his work more local and focused on cultural and traditional teachings, and education. His roots in the group often got overshadowed by more powerful personalities in the movement, including Russell Means, Dennis Banks and John Trudell, said Akim Reinhardt, a history professor at Towson University in Maryland.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It's a shame, because clearly when we listen to the people who were there, they all mention him,\" said Reinhardt, who has written broadly about the movement.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Lisa Bellanger, executive director of the National American Indian Movement and Benton-Banai's former assistant, said he was instrumental in the group's work using treaties to protect the rights of Indigenous people. He was also part of a team that pushed for the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, she said, as government policies stifled or outlawed religious practices. The law safeguarded the rights of American Indians to practice their religion and access sacred sites. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Bellanger said Benton-Banai also helped launch the International Indian Treaty Council, which advocates for the rights of Indigenous nations to govern themselves, and for the protection of tradition, culture and sacred land.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In addition to his activism work, Benton-Banai was a father figure. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We could always go to him with questions,\" Bellanger said. “We could run crying to him if we needed to. We had that personal faith and trust and love in him, at a time that was crucial for young girls.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Day said Benton-Banai was raised by his grandparents and grew up speaking Ojibwe. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He had a very solid spiritual foundation to his traditional and Indigenous learning, and that’s what made him, I believe, who he was,” she said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His book, “The Mishomis Book” is touted as the first of its kind to offer Anishinaabe families an understanding of spiritual teachings. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Benton-Banai also founded a school in St. Paul in 1972, called the Red School House, which — along with its sister school in Minneapolis — fueled a broader movement to provide alternative education for Indigenous children so they could learn while maintaining their spiritual and cultural practices, Day said. They were known as survival schools.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Bellecourt said American Indian Movement's philosophy of using the sovereignty and spirituality of Indigenous people as a strength can be attributed to Benton-Banai's leadership. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I considered him our holy man,\" he said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Fonseca reported from Flagstaff, Arizona.\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":1,"shortId":"eda9f977c99904f013bad01649e8dada","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/eda9f977c99904f013bad01649e8dada","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 09:55:46","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Eddie Benton-Banai, who helped found the American Indian Movement partly in response to alleged police brutality against Indigenous people, has died.

Or it could accept the case and issue a decision later. It could also just render a decision based on the written arguments, although that would be unusual.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Attorneys for Evers, as well as lawyers from the state Department of Justice representing the Wisconsin Elections Commission, urged the court not to accept original jurisdiction of the case, saying it must start in lower courts.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“President Trump’s (lawsuit) seeks nothing less than to overturn the will of nearly 3.3 million Wisconsin voters,” Evers' attorneys said. “It is a shocking and outrageous assault on our democracy. ... He is simply trying to seize Wisconsin’s electoral votes, even though he lost the statewide election.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s lawsuit repeats many claims he made during a recount of votes in Milwaukee and Dane counties. He seeks to disqualify 170,140 absentee ballots that were cast early, in-person, saying there wasn't a proper written request made for the ballots; 28,395 absentee ballots cast by those who claimed “indefinitely confined” status; 17,271 absentee ballots collected by poll workers at Madison parks; and 5,517 absentee ballots where clerks filled in missing information on the envelope the ballots were placed in.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;None of the ballots Trump challenged during the recount were discounted by elections officials in Dane and Milwaukee counties. Evers argues in his filings that there is no legal basis for the ballots not to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;For example, Evers notes that the Wisconsin Elections Commission agreed more than four years ago to allow election clerks to fill in missing information on envelopes containing absentee ballots.

Emergency Management Agency said they were harassed or discriminated against based on their gender or race, according to a survey released Wednesday as part of the fallout from allegations of sexual harassment by a senior official at the organization. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The survey by the RAND Corp. found that such civil rights violations were “common” at FEMA, reported by about 29% of the employees surveyed last year. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;FEMA requested the survey in response to an internal report that found that the former head of the agency’s personnel office had improper sexual relationships with subordinates and created a “toxic” work environment, including by giving preferential treatment to his fraternity brothers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The official resigned from FEMA and the agency took steps to address the allegations, including creating an office of professional responsibility and requiring all of the nearly 20,000 employees to undergo anti-harassment training. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor said the agency would be taking additional measures in the coming months. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Even though the data from this survey is more than a year and a half behind us, these findings are alarming and simply not acceptable,” Gaynor said in a statement issued as the RAND survey data was released.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a statement, the agency detailed a series of actions it has taken to address issues raised in the 2018 internal report, which included conducting an audit of hiring decisions taken under the former head of personnel and directing its Office of Equal Rights to address a backlog of cases. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;FEMA also created a Culture Improvement Action Plan with the goal of ensuring employees feel “valued and can meet the mission to the best of their ability without fear and in an environment free of harassment and misconduct.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The report featured responses from nearly 9,000 employees at the agency that leads the U.S. response to natural disasters and managed an airlift to bring in huge supplies of protective medical gear and equipment in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It found that 20% of FEMA employees reported harassment and discrimination on the basis of sex. A little more than 18% reported violations based on their race or ethnicity.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Few people felt comfortable reporting the violations, with employees saying they believed their complaint would not be addressed or they would face retaliation. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There are few, publicly available studies of employee discrimination with comparable data, so it is difficult to compare the FEMA results with other organizations. RAND conducted a similar study at the Department of Defense, but that population is more male and younger. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That earlier survey found 24% of women in the military experienced sexual harassment, slightly higher than what was found for women at FEMA.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The findings are also in line with an Edison Research 2018 poll that found 21% of Americans said they had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, including 27% of women and 14% of men. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Coreen Farris, the lead author of RAND’s report on FEMA, said the results will provide a baseline for a follow-up survey planned for this spring. “Changing organizational culture and climate is no easy task, but one vital component is measurement of the problem,” she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;FEMA requested the study after the allegations against the former head of personnel led to an internal investigation that revealed systemic problems at the agency. The former official, Corey Coleman, resigned in June 2018, as the probe was underway. \u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":1,"shortId":"e270e25422c79840afa3be45b0211cb9","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/e270e25422c79840afa3be45b0211cb9","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"unitedstatesgovernment":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"united states government","isPr":null,"order":0},"federalemergencymanagementagency":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"federal emergency management agency","isPr":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:35:55","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"WASHINGTON (AP) — More than a quarter of employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said they were harassed or discriminated against based on their gender or race, according to a survey...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:e270e25422c79840afa3be45b0211cb9","media":[],"disableConnatix":false,"hons":false,"headlinePlacement":null,"revision":null,"videoContext":null,"description":null,"embargoDate":null,"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:7710620049"],"omitFromFeed":false,"sponsored":false,"storyLayout":null,"tagIds":["Personnel","Emergencymanagement","Coronaviruspandemic","apf-politics","Raceandethnicity"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By BEN FOX","leadPhotoId":"40563b085c0e42ceb07c78805b9afb98"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","omitFromFeed":false,"isFullScreen":false,"topLineColor":null,"sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"endDateTime":null,"notificationTypeId":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"height":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hideDate":false,"virtual":true,"poll_key":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"archived":false,"localMemberName":null,"ignoreAlertMedia":false,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"pollFilters":{},"shortId":"a393edda76827ce1f5f694777b09768c","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"sound":null,"disclaimerText":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"xxUpdated":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"hubPositions":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"customLayoutType":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"teams":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:a393edda76827ce1f5f694777b09768c","pollId":null,"hideOtherTeams":false,"displayPositionHome":null,"contents":[{"block_fundamentals":true,"embedHeight":null,"stackedStory":false,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["7cba3d56fb93461cb9dabebcf9ddc75f","93ee986371f34086bcdf0800463389bd","7ded3511333b48a3b7fd8ec7f1881746","3edcafa92d744f7e9eee07950b0471b6","d69b86e27b7947dc8a15f755bf5a38e6","e5bb4bc53c9d40648ccd53726d406816","9b87c7c78dba429d9cbd6b82f80c6eb2"],"old_lead_video_key":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"title":"FBN--Ravens-Steelers","headline":"Steelers overcome rust, short-handed Ravens to move to 11-0","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"a393edda76827ce1f5f694777b09768c_2a18aza0c0","latestEtag":null,"updated":"2020-12-03 01:22:02","contentType":"text","canonicalUrl":"nfl-robert-griffin-mark-ingram-pittsburgh-football","embedRatio":null,"audioMediumIds":[],"layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"canonicalName":"sports","order":4,"id":"apf-sports","isPr":null,"name":"Sports"},{"canonicalName":"nfl","order":0,"id":"NFL","isPr":null,"name":"NFL"},{"canonicalName":"ap-top-news","order":10,"id":"apf-topnews","isPr":false,"name":"AP Top News"},{"canonicalName":"pittsburgh","order":0,"id":"Pittsburgh","isPr":null,"name":"Pittsburgh"},{"canonicalName":"mike-tomlin","order":0,"id":"MikeTomlin","isPr":null,"name":"Mike Tomlin"},{"canonicalName":"football","order":0,"id":"Football","isPr":null,"name":"Football"},{"canonicalName":"baltimore-ravens","order":0,"id":"BaltimoreRavens","isPr":null,"name":"Baltimore Ravens"},{"canonicalName":"pittsburgh-steelers","order":0,"id":"PittsburghSteelers","isPr":null,"name":"Pittsburgh Steelers"}],"disableNativo":false,"alertLinkDateTime":null,"embedCaption":null,"version":null,"leadVideoAutoEmbed":true,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:a393edda76827ce1f5f694777b09768c","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp&gt;PITTSBURGH (AP) — Mike Tomlin isn't one for excuses.

Even as COVID-19 wreaked havoc with his team's schedule, pushing their matchup with Baltimore from Thanksgiving night to middle of the afternoon in the middle of the week in the middle of a pandemic, the longtime Pittsburgh Steelers coach refused to reach for one.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;So while the Steelers stayed perfect with a disjointed 19-14 win over the undermanned Ravens in the first NFL game on a Wednesday in eight years, their play was anything but. And Tomlin knows it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“To be bluntly honest, I’m really disappointed in our performance tonight,” he said after Pittsburgh improved to 11-0. “We did enough to win tonight, that’s all.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Calling it “junior varsity”-level play, Tomlin seethed in the aftermath, a testament to both how high the bar is set and just how far the Steelers came from clearing it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Asked about an offense that managed just one touchdown in four trips to the red zone — missed opportunities that allowed the Ravens (6-5) to hang around until the final minutes — Tomlin didn't offer analysis as much as rage.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Us sucking,” he said, declining to get into specifics.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There really was no need to.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Steelers turned it over twice, once on a fourth-down heave into the end zone by Ben Roethlisberger, the other a fumbled punt by Ray-Ray McLoud that set up a 1-yard touchdown plunge by Gus Edwards. They let Baltimore backup quarterback Robert Griffin III briefly turn back the clock to his 2012 Rookie of the Year season and looked at times like a team in the middle of ho-hum midweek practice — which, to be fair, Wednesdays typically are — rather than a showdown with its longtime rivals.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Obviously we won, but it sure doesn’t feel like it,” said Roethlisberger, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/steelers/status/1334271470344790022\"&gt;whose 1-yard strike to JuJu Smith-Schuster\u003c/a&gt; early in the fourth quarter gave the Steelers a 12-point lead they flirted with squandering. \"Just not good football. It starts with me. It’s a mental game, it’s been a challenging and draining week but at the end of the day we need to step on the field and play good football when it’s time.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pittsburgh didn't for long stretches, though some of the credit goes to a spirited effort from the Ravens. Running onto Heinz Field missing more than a dozen players on the reserve/COVID-19 list, including reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson and running backs Mark Ingram and J.K. Dobbins, Baltimore didn't exactly roll over.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;While Griffin completed just 7 of 12 passes for 33 yards and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1334241304595714049\"&gt;a first-quarter Pick-6 by Joe Haden\u003c/a&gt; that gave the Steelers an early lead, Griffin ran for a game-high 68 yards before leaving in the fourth quarter with a left hamstring injury. Trace McSorley, one of 11 players promoted from the practice squad, came on and connected with Marquise Brown \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1334278858229436417\"&gt;for a 70-yard touchdown\u003c/a&gt; with 2:58 to go. But the Steelers were able to drain the clock behind a third-down grab by James Washington, eliminating the Ravens from repeating as AFC North champions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The way the game went, obviously we wanted to win,” Griffin said. “We felt like we had a chance to come in here and win, shock the world and do something special. I put it on myself. I feel like if I didn’t pull my hamstring in the second quarter we would have won. It was really emotional trying to fight through that. I feel like I let my guys down.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A COVID-19 outbreak in Baltimore forced the NFL to push the game back three times: first from Thanksgiving to Sunday, then from Sunday to Tuesday, and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nfl-pittsburgh-mike-tomlin-football-baltimore-ravens-f44acb03e207e9055c54125c79d0a918\"&gt;eventually from Tuesday to Wednesday\u003c/a&gt;. The teams kicked off in the afternoon to not interfere with NBC's annual Christmas special at Rockefeller Center.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Good idea. The fewer eyeballs on this one the better.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called it “a great game,\" the product on the field suggested otherwise.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Ravens couldn't pass. Pittsburgh's receivers couldn't catch. And a contest that looked like a mismatch — the Steelers went off as 10 1/2-point favorites, a rarity in a rivalry that is one of the NFL's best — was instead a festival of blah.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;PILING ON\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Ravens were trailing 12-7 late in the second quarter when a 39-yard sprint by Griffin helped move the ball to the Pittsburgh 1. A handoff to Gus Edwards on second down went nowhere. Out of timeouts, the Ravens could have spiked the ball to set up a field goal to draw within two at the break. Instead, Baltimore nearly converted, but Luke Willson — a reserve who had played all of 21 offensive snaps on the season coming in — couldn’t bring in Griffin's pass in the end zone.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ravens coach John Harbaugh thought Pittsburgh's defense took its time — perhaps too much of it — getting up after stopping Edwards, allowing the clock to tick away.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We knew we had enough time to run the two plays we wanted to run,” He said. “I just feel like if you’re laying on the ground like that you’re either injured or it’s delay of game.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;INJURIES\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ravens: Cornerback Jimmy Smith left with a groin injury in the first half.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Steelers: Outside linebacker Bud Dupree exited in the fourth with what appeared to be a knee injury.

(AP) — It wasn’t long after Texas arrived for the relocated Maui Invitational that coach Shaka Smart pointed out the banners hanging above the court to recognize the tournament’s past champions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We said: ‘There’s no Texas on these banners,’” Smart said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There will be now, thanks to Matt Coleman III’s clock-beating shot and a defensive effort that carried the 17th-ranked Longhorns to their first title.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Coleman hit a stepback jumper with 0.1 seconds left to help Texas beat No. 14 North Carolina 69-67 in Wednesday's final, capping a wild finish that saw the Longhorns regroup after blowing a 16-point lead and falling behind late.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Coleman finished with 22 points and was the most valuable player for the Longhorns (4-0), securing the program's first Maui title in their fifth appearance.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The senior led the offense all day long, making 9 of 16 shots with three 3-pointers. And he was ready for his clutch moment, saying he even smirked during the preceding timeout with a single thought: “I was just made for times like this.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Coleman dribbled down the clock against UNC's RJ Davis and made his move. The lefty drove to the foul line, and then sprung back to launch a soft jumper over Davis' outstretched arm from near the right elbow.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The ball bounced the rim, then the backboard, then through the net.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Soft touch, baby,” Coleman said. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It was on line. I knew I didn't leave it short. It just had to play with the rim a little bit, create some suspense for the fans — that's all,\" Coleman continued with a chuckle.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Tar Heels (3-1) could only heave the ball the length of the court for a miracle that never materialized.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“RJ tried to do a good job and Matt hit a tough shot,” UNC coach Roy Williams said. \"If we had had a little more experienced team, we would have probably tried to double-team. ... But it's what it was, and you've got to congratulate Matt for making a shot.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BIG PICTURE\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Texas: The Longhorns won two games in three days that came down to the final seconds, first with Courtney Ramey hitting a driving shot with 20 seconds left and then surviving two final-possession 3-pointers to edge Davidson in Monday's first round. They also locked down Indiana by holding the Hoosiers to 44 points — their lowest output since January 2010 — before spending more than a half frustrating the Tar Heels. Then, after squandering their lead, the Longhorns held on to beat UNC for the ninth time in 10 meetings. They ended up holding their last two Maui opponents to a combined 33.7% shooting.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We clearly were a little fatigued,\" Smart said. \"We weren’t necessarily clicking on all cylinders. ... But if you want to be a good team, you got to find ways to win on days like that. And our guys hung in there and did that.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;UNC: The Tar Heels dug themselves a huge hole in this one, then climbed back after having just four second-half turnovers and doing a better job of getting the ball inside. But there were no shortage of missed opportunities. That included 10 first-half turnovers, missing six of seven shots down the stretch and making just 18 of 32 free throws. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“In the second half (Williams) just told us to go out there and fight and just be competitors and we did it,” sophomore big man Armando Bacot said, “but unfortunately we just lost on a last-second shot.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BROOKS’ EFFORT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;UNC's Garrison Brooks, the preseason Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year, finished with 18 points and seven rebounds despite playing through an ankle injury that sent him to the locker room at least twice. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BIG LEAD, BIG COMEBACK\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Texas used a 26-5 run to turn a five-point deficit into a 36-20 lead on Greg Brown’s free throws with 3:50 left in the first half. But the Tar Heels roared out of halftime with five straight scoring possessions. They clawed to within one five different times before finally tying it on a free throw from Caleb Love with 3:54 left and then taking their first post-halftime lead on Brooks’ contested turnaround with 2:35 to go.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;JONES' SPARK\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Texas reserve Kai Jones had a few clutch moments of his own, too.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He had 12 points, answering Brooks' score with a tying jumper and then scoring on a transition dunk with 41.2 seconds remaining that pushed Texas to a 67-65 lead. UNC’s Leaky Black answered with two free throws with 25.6 seconds left, setting up Coleman's winner.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;DIFFERENT SETTING\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The tournament was played in the North Carolina mountains instead of its traditional Hawaii setting due to the coronavirus pandemic. That gave the Tar Heels three games in Williams’ hometown with fan cutouts in the stands and crowd noise pumped in.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;UP NEXT\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Texas: The Longhorns host No. 12 Villanova on Sunday in the Big 12-Big East Battle.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;UNC: The Tar Heels visit third-ranked Iowa on Tuesday in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap \u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":7,"shortId":"ab3a55c690960b6a42ddbb35183aeefc","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/ab3a55c690960b6a42ddbb35183aeefc","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"texaslonghornsmensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"texas longhorns men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0},"northcarolinatarheelsmensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"north carolina tar heels men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0},"big12conferencemensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"big 12 conference men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0},"atlanticcoastconferencemensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"atlantic coast conference men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 08:56:36","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"ASHEVILLE, N.C.

So illegal. It’s about ballots that poured in and nobody but a few knew where they came from. ... It’s about machinery that was defective, machinery that was stopped.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;None of those assertions are true.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A look at the claims and reality:\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;VOTER FRAUD\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “You can’t let another person steal that election from you.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: To be clear, no election was stolen from Trump.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One month after the Nov. 3 election and as states begin certifying their votes, Trump is clinging to false notions of voter fraud that Attorney General William Barr disputed as unsubstantiated and not significant enough to overturn Biden’s margin of victory.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden earned 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232, the same margin that Trump had when he beat Hillary Clinton in 2016, which he repeatedly described as a “landslide.” (Trump ended up with 304 electoral votes because two electors defected.) Biden achieved victory by prevailing in key states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s allegations of massive voting fraud have been refuted by a variety of judges, state election officials and an arm of his own administration’s Homeland Security Department. Many of his campaign’s lawsuits across the country have been thrown out of court. And his administration has \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-national-security-rob-portman-coronavirus-pandemic-ac923137dfb664e5c3a1923f52eebbad\"&gt; already agreed\u003c/a&gt; to allow the formal transition of power to Biden to begin.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Tuesday, Barr told The Associated Press that no proof of widespread voter fraud has been uncovered. “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;No case has established irregularities of a scale that would change the outcome. Lawsuits that remain do not contain evidence that would flip the result.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BALLOT ‘DUMPING’\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “I go from winning by a lot to losing a tight race. It’s corrupt.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “It’s about big leads on election night, tremendous leads, leads where I was being congratulated for a decisive, easy victory, and all of a sudden by morning or a couple of days later, those leads rapidly evaporated.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: No mass corruption happened. Trump is actually describing a legitimate vote counting process, not a sudden surge of malfeasance that no one has seen before.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Indeed, news organizations and officials had warned in the days and weeks leading up to the election that the results would likely come in just as they did: In-person votes, which tend to be counted more quickly, would likely favor the president, who had spent months warning his supporters to avoid mail-in voting and to vote in person either early or on Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And mail-in ballots, which take longer to count since they must be removed from envelopes and verified before they are counted, would favor Biden. That pattern was exacerbated by the fact that many states prohibited early counting of mail-in votes that arrived before Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In addition, big cities are often slower to report their numbers, and those votes tend to skew Democratic. Likewise, many states tend to count mail-in ballots at the end of the process. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “In Wisconsin, as an example, where we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes. And I can show you right here that Wisconsin, we’re leading by a lot, and then at 3:42 in the morning, there was this. It was a massive dump of votes. Mostly Biden.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: No, there wasn’t a “massive dump of votes” in the middle of the night. Milwaukee election officials finished counting the city’s roughly 169,000 absentee ballots around 3 a.m. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wisconsin law requires the results of those absentee ballots be reported all at once. The count of the absentee ballots was livestreamed on YouTube for anyone to watch. When it was finished, Milwaukee police escorted the city’s elections director from a central counting location to the county courthouse to deliver thumb drives with the ballot data.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;DOMINION\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP, on Dominion Voting Systems electoral software used in many states: “When you look at who’s running the company, who’s in charge, who owns it — which we don’t know — where are the votes counted — which we think are counted in foreign countries, not in the United States — Dominion is a disaster.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: Servers that run Dominion software are in local election offices, not in foreign countries. Claims that the company has foreign servers or ties to Germany or Venezuela are false. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s true that the company is privately held and does not disclose its financials, but the New York-based private equity firm Staple Street Capital has owned a majority stake in Dominion since 2018. Fictional claims that Dianne Feinstein, the Clinton family, Nancy Pelosi and Hugo Chavez are owners of Dominion have been debunked. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised” in the 2020 election, according to a joint statement released by the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “In one Michigan county, as an example, that used Dominion systems, they found that nearly 6,000 votes had been wrongly switched from Trump to Biden. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is what we caught. How many didn’t we catch?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s a misrepresentation.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s true that a tabulation problem in the 2020 election involved a few thousand votes in Antrim County, Michigan. But that was the result of human error.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When the Republican-leaning county initially reported a landslide win for Biden, social media users grew suspicious about the Dominion election management system used to tabulate the data. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It turned out Dominion was not to blame, according to the Michigan Department of State. “There was no malice, no fraud here, just human error,” County Clerk Sheryl Guy told the AP. The tabulation error was corrected.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Eddie Perez, a voting technology expert at the OSET Institute, a nonpartisan election technology research and development nonprofit, agreed that the Michigan case was the result of human error involving voting technology, not the software itself.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;‘DEAD’ VOTERS\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “Dead people — and we have many examples — filled out ballots, made applications and then voted.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: He’s repeating a false claim of dead people voting, particularly in Pennsylvania and Michigan. But there’s no evidence that this occurred, and officials in both states say the claims are unfounded.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The false claim that deceased voters cast ballots “comes up every election,” said Jason Roberts, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Experts told the AP that it is common for state voter rolls to include voters with birthdates that make them appear impossibly old, but these are usually explained by human error, software quirks or voter confidentiality issues.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“A similar complaint was brought before a PA court — and soundly rejected,” the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General said in a statement. “The court found no deficiency in how PA maintains its voter rolls, and there is currently no proof provided that any deceased person has voted in the 2020 election.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for Michigan’s secretary of state’s office, told the AP that on rare occasions a ballot received from a voter may be recorded as though that person is too old to be alive. This can occur when an incorrect birth year is entered on voter rolls.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some of the claims about dead voters appear to stem from a federal lawsuit that alleges Pennsylvania failed to “maintain accurate and current voter rolls” that include 21,000 apparently deceased registrants. But that is not the same as votes from dead people being cast and counted. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative group based in Indiana, amended the lawsuit on Nov. 5 against Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The group has taken legal action in a handful of places to try to force voter roll pruning. In December 2019, the group filed a lawsuit against Detroit election officials alleging that the city had over 2,500 dead people on the voter rolls — including one born in 1823.

They were not allowed to be present. ... They were thrown out of the building.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: He’s incorrect.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump is wholly misrepresenting a court case in the state and what happened at voting places. No one tried to ban poll watchers representing each side in the election. Democrats did not try to stop Republican representatives from being able to observe the process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The main issue in the case was how close observers representing the parties could get to election workers who were processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia. Trump’s representatives sued to allow the observers to get closer than the guidelines had allowed. A court ruled in favor of that request.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The counting in Philadelphia was being livestreamed, and Trump’s lawyers admitted in court that their campaign had observers in the room — “a nonzero” number of them, as they put it. Poll watchers have no role in counting votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press writers Arijeta Lajka, Michael Balsamo and Colleen Long contributed to this report. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___ \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;EDITOR'S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___ \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Find AP Fact Checks at http://apnews.com/APFactCheck \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p&gt;","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":1,"shortId":"49a24edd6d10888dbad61689c24b05a5","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/49a24edd6d10888dbad61689c24b05a5","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"unitedstatesgovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"united states government","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"pennsylvaniaattorneygeneralsoffice":{"isPr":null,"name":"pennsylvania attorney general's office","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"pennsylvaniastategovernment":{"isPr":null,"name":"pennsylvania state government","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"usdepartmentofstate":{"isPr":null,"name":"u.s. department of state","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2020-12-03 10:35:55","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"Clinging to notions of widespread vote rigging that his own attorney general  has disputed, President Donald Trump repeated a litany of baseless assertions Wednesday of political corruption,...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:49a24edd6d10888dbad61689c24b05a5","media":[],"disableConnatix":false,"hons":false,"headlinePlacement":null,"revision":null,"videoContext":null,"description":null,"embargoDate":null,"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:7579100025","afs:Reporter:8985942508","afs:Reporter:7540890213"],"omitFromFeed":false,"sponsored":true,"storyLayout":null,"tagIds":["apf-technology","Media","APFactCheck","Elections","JoeBiden","apf-politics","Election2020","DonaldTrump"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By HOPE YEN, ALI SWENSON and AMANDA SEITZ","leadPhotoId":"2371454877324dada875f082adb4dc4a"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","omitFromFeed":false,"isFullScreen":false,"topLineColor":null,"sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"endDateTime":null,"notificationTypeId":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"height":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hideDate":false,"virtual":true,"poll_key":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"archived":false,"localMemberName":null,"ignoreAlertMedia":false,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"pollFilters":{},"shortId":"11baedaf76fdab9949f215dcd5101a04","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"sound":null,"disclaimerText":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"xxUpdated":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"hubPositions":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"customLayoutType":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"teams":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:11baedaf76fdab9949f215dcd5101a04","pollId":null,"hideOtherTeams":false,"displayPositionHome":null,"contents":[{"block_fundamentals":true,"embedHeight":null,"stackedStory":false,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["cb1c4d155f4f4029b79df80160245f33","c01bde5e77fd49b5a6151b48e8804add","6259b592e873488d920e8bada991b739","7c37f3b6374b44afb5a7a845368c656b","f8c4a350e5f4437799aec879d0053df4","cd606e4df52c4d2ca186013d3248bf11","a4ddcf0e67764cc490fa6c21d99e576e"],"old_lead_video_key":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"title":"US--Film Review-I'm Your Woman","headline":"Review: Reorienting the crime drama in 'I'm Your Woman' ","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"11baedaf76fdab9949f215dcd5101a04_1a5aza0c0","latestEtag":null,"updated":"2020-12-03 00:51:24","contentType":"text","canonicalUrl":"entertainment-film-reviews-rachel-brosnahan","embedRatio":null,"audioMediumIds":[],"layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"canonicalName":"entertainment","order":8,"id":"apf-entertainment","isPr":null,"name":"Entertainment"},{"canonicalName":"film-reviews","order":0,"id":"FilmReviews","isPr":null,"name":"Film Reviews"},{"canonicalName":"rachel-brosnahan","order":0,"id":"RachelBrosnahan","isPr":null,"name":"Rachel Brosnahan"}],"disableNativo":false,"alertLinkDateTime":null,"embedCaption":null,"version":null,"leadVideoAutoEmbed":true,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:11baedaf76fdab9949f215dcd5101a04","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp&gt;When it's at its best, “I'm Your Woman” feels like you've slipped through a trap door, revealing a hidden pathway in an old genre apparatus.

The camera doesn't stick with the usual characters. It has other interests.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAveuCPBYSw\"&gt;“I'm Your Woman,\"\u003c/a&gt; which debuts Friday in theaters and Dec. 11 on Amazon Prime Video, is directed by Julia Hart, who also wrote the script with her husband, the producer (and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP_ypoHMJi8\"&gt;Oscar flub hero\u003c/a&gt; ) Jordan Horowitz. Rachel Brosnahan (\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\") stars as Jean, the kind of woman typically relegated to bit character in more masculine dramas. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;She's sitting in their suburban home when her husband Eddie (Bill Heck) comes home and presents a new baby the way someone might unveil a new toaster. “Who is that?” Jean says. “He's our baby,” he answers, beaming. We get no more information than she does, as the film immediately drops us into the disorientation of Jean's world as the kept woman of a man we soon learn is some kind of gangster. But even Jean doesn't seem to know much about what he does. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Instead of Eddie coming home one night, Jean is roused by a knock at the door. The man, Cal (a very good Arinze Kene), explains men are after Eddie, and soon will be looking for Jean, too. They have to go. Whatever Eddie did or whoever his pursuers are remains, like Jean's own hazy understanding, in the distant background. Instead, the film rigorously stays with her as she and the baby are plunged into a loosely connected underworld meant to shield her from whatever trouble is after her. Eventually, she'll reach for a gun, herself.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hart's schematic framework is a worthy and intriguing one, yet “I'm Your Woman” struggles to turn thesis into drama. Jean slowly transforms into a more conscious, decision-making woman but her character's psychology doesn't fill out. Even with growing independence, Jean remains a perplexingly passive genre fragment in a narrative that never comes into focus — though it continues to compellingly bring in elements usually kept at bay in the crime film, like family and race. It's also possible that Brosnahan, so identifiable already as the unflinching Midge Maisel, is too charismatic and clever to convince us otherwise.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hart \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-rachel-brosnahan-michael-mann-tuesday-weld-f255c50af7a556021830fd6373110ecf\"&gt;has spoken about how she was pulled to make “I'm Your Woman” by wanting to follow Diane Keaton in “The Godfather” or Tuesday Weld in “Thief.”\u003c/a&gt; It's a tantalizing concept, one that “I'm Your Woman” comes close to achieving. Hart, gifted as a filmmaker rich in both texture and ideas, has already skipped around in genre, often reorienting it in the process. Her 2019 sci-fi film \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tySUZIiXObc\"&gt;“Fast Color” \u003c/a&gt; told a human-scaled superhero story about three women in a family with superhuman powers. It will be exciting to see what genre she tackles — and potentially remakes — next. In the meantime, I wouldn't mind knowing where that baby came from.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"I'm Your Woman,” an Amazon Studios release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for violence and language.

He was assigned to the pediatric unit’s medical-surgical area but said he might come across patients with the coronavirus.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Brown's resolve to help patients as a nurse was reaffirmed after his 90-year-old grandfather contracted the virus and died over the weekend.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The staff that he had were great, and they really took a lot of pressure off of my folks and my family,” he said. “I think that if I can be that for another family, that would be great.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;The University of Iowa’s College of Nursing is also trying to get graduates into the workforce quickly. It worked to fast-track students’ transcripts to the Iowa Board of Nursing so they could get licensed sooner upon graduating, said Anita Nicholson, associate dean for undergraduate programs.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nicholson said the college also scheduled senior internships earlier than normal and created a program that allows students to gain hospital experience under a nurse’s supervision. Those students aren’t caring for coronavirus patients, but their work frees up nurses to do so, Nicholson said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The sooner we can get our graduates out and into the workforce, the better,” she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wausau, Wisconsin-based Aspirus Health Care is offering signing bonuses of up to $15,000 for nurses with a year of experience.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9795542421\"&gt;Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hospitals also are turning to nurses who travel from state to state. But that's expensive, because hospitals around the country are competing for them, driving salaries as high as $6,200 per week, according to postings for travel nursing jobs.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;April Hansen, executive vice president at San Diego-based Aya Healthcare, said there are now 31,000 openings for travel nurses, more than twice the number being sought when the pandemic surged in the spring.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It is crazy,\" Hansen said. “It doesn’t matter if you are rural or urban, if you are an Indian health facility or an academic medical center or anything in between. ... All facilities are experiencing increased demand right now.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nurses who work in intensive care and on medical-surgical floors are the most in demand. Employers also are willing to pay extra for nurses who can show up on short notice and work 48 or 60 hours per week instead of the standard 36. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Laura Cutolo, a 32-year-old emergency room and ICU nurse from Gilbert, Arizona, began travel nursing when the pandemic began, landing in New York during the deadliest stretch of the U.S. outbreak last spring. She is now working in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and soon will return to New York. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She said she hopes her work will be an example to her children, now 2 and 5, when the crisis passes into history and they read about it someday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If they ask me, ’Where were you?' I can be proud of where I was and what I did,\" Cutolo said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Doctors are in demand, too.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I don’t even practice anymore, and I’ve gotten lots of emails asking me to travel across the country to work in ERs,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The outbreak in the U.S. is blamed for more than 270,000 deaths and 13.8 million confirmed infections. New cases are running at over 160,000 a day on average, and deaths are up to more than 1,500 a day, a level seen back in May, during the crisis in the New York City area. Several states reported huge numbers of new cases Wednesday, including a combined 40,000 in California, Illinois and Florida alone.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;States are seeing record-breaking surges in deaths, including Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky in the middle of the country. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the virus is “spreading like wildfire.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A COVID-19 vaccine is expected to become available in a few weeks, and health care workers are likely to be given priority for the first shots. That could make it easier for hospitals to recruit help.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;To make room for the sickest, hard-hit institutions are sending home some COVID-19 patients who otherwise would have been kept in the hospital. They are also canceling elective surgeries or sending adult non-COVID-19 patients to pediatric hospitals. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A hospital system in Idaho is sending some COVID-19 patients home with iPads, supplemental oxygen, blood pressure cuffs and oxygen monitors so they can finish recovering in their own beds. The computer tablets enable nurses to check in with them, and the oxygen monitors automatically send back vital information.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Across the U.S., hospitals are converting cafeterias, waiting rooms, even a parking garage to patient treatment areas. Some states are opening field hospitals.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But that does nothing to ease the staffing shortage, especially in rural areas where officials say many people aren't taking basic precautions against the virus.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Dr. Eli Perencevich, an epidemiology and internal medicine professor at the University of Iowa, said health care workers are paying the price for other people's refusal to wear masks.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s sending everyone to war, really,” he said. “We’ve decided as a society that we’re going to take all the people in our health care system and pummel them because we have some insane idea about what freedom really is.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Forliti reported from Minneapolis.

Last month, the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-steve-dickson-coronavirus-pandemic-airlines-c7fb5a10cc92354a792fd19d0028cf68\"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration approved changes\u003c/a&gt; — mainly in flight-control software — that will allow airlines to resume flying the plane.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;American flew journalists from Dallas to the airline's maintenance center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where crews explained how they are bringing the planes out of storage and making FAA-required changes. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;American is likely to be the first carrier to put passengers on Max jets, beginning Dec. 29 with once-a-day round trips between New York and Miami. In the meantime, the airline plans flights with employees on board.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some relatives of people who died in the crashes — and who still believe the plane is unsafe — expressed outrage at both Boeing and American over what they termed a publicity stunt.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Zipporah Kuria, a British citizen whose father died in the second Max crash, said Boeing and the FAA should instead turn over documents on changes made to fix the plane and how they were tested. The company has withheld the documents, saying they cover trade secrets.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I feel like Boeing is using the press to leverage public trust instead of actually genuinely earning public trust,” she said. “I'm really disgusted by the whole thing and the fact that American Airlines would pay for that. Their focus is more about the profit and corporate interest than it is about consumer safety.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some people who lost family members believe that the FAA erred by not accepting all the recommendations made by pilots and aviation professionals during a public comment period on its proposal to let the plane fly again. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Scrutiny of the plane has focused on a flight-control system called MCAS, which repeatedly pushed down the nose of the plane before both crashes. Boeing, which describes \u003ca href=\"http://www.boeing.com/737-max-updates/#what-has-to-happen-for-the-airplane-to-return-to-commercial-service\"&gt;changes to the plane \u003c/a&gt; on its website, and the FAA say the system has been made less powerful and easier for pilots to override. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some of the family members, however, wanted a deeper, nose-to-tail review of the plane. And they don't trust Boeing or the FAA, which allowed the plane to keep flying after the first crash, in Indonesia in 2018.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It hasn't been evaluated to the point where we can say that it's safe,” said Nadia Milleron, whose daughter was killed in the second crash, which occurred in Ethiopia. “This plane hasn't flown very much with this new software, the revamped MCAS, interfacing with the plane. It's not responsible for them to put you on this flight.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chicago-based Boeing said Wednesday it has flown more than 1,400 test flights on updated Max planes. The FAA said its people put in 60,000 hours reviewing and testing Boeing's work.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;American is likely to be the only U.S. carrier using the Max for several weeks. United Airlines expects to put the plane back in its schedule during the first quarter of next year, with Southwest following in the second quarter. Regulators in Europe and Brazil have cleared a path for their airlines to resume Max flights in a few weeks.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's unclear whether the flying public will accept the plane or avoid it. Some industry officials believe that fear of getting on the plane has lessened with time. American says that if customers don't want to fly on a Max, it will have the flexibility to put them on other planes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;David Koenig can be reached at

Because of the limited initial supply, the first shots will be reserved for those most in danger, namely nursing home residents, the elderly and health care workers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommended the vaccine after clinical trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers showed it was 95% effective and turned up no serious side effects. The vaccine is still considered experimental while final testing is done.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is an unprecedented piece of science,” given that the vaccine was authorized less than a year after the virus was discovered, said David Harper, senior consulting fellow in global health at the Chatham House think tank.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that the “searchlights of science” had picked out the “invisible enemy,” which has been blamed for close to 60,000 deaths in Britain. He said that in developing the vaccine, scientists had performed “biological jujitsu” by turning the virus on itself.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other countries aren’t far behind: Regulators in not only the U.S. but the European Union and Canada also are vetting the Pfizer vaccine along with a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/moderna-asks-regulators-ok-virus-shots-a65a00cdf9725c9104886ded9052a85d\"&gt;shot made by Moderna\u003c/a&gt;. British and Canadian regulators are also considering \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-f52858d0d5524147270201a0f301e6aa\"&gt;a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University\u003c/a&gt;. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"c4544c20-2e30-11eb-ecfa-393f5470504b\"&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;Amid growing concern that Americans will greet vaccines with skepticism, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Britain’s decision “should give Americans additional confidence in the quality of such a vaccine.” The virus has killed more than 270,000 in the U.S. On Wednesday, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on an expert panel’s recommendation that health care workers and nursing home residents be the first to be vaccinated when shots become available.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hancock said Britain will begin receiving the first shipment of 800,000 doses from Belgium within days, and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-germany-immunizations-coronavirus-pandemic-3ac7e19981b7937f0f08a29667ddf09e\"&gt;people will start getting the shots \u003c/a&gt; as soon as it arrives. Two doses three weeks apart are required. The country expects to receive millions of doses by the end of this year, Hancock said, though the exact number will depend on how fast it can be manufactured and checked for quality.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That is only a fraction of what will be needed as public health officials try to vaccinate much of the world’s population. Experts have said several vaccines will be required to quickly end the pandemic that has infected more than 64 million people globally.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Britain, the first shots will go to nursing home residents and those who care for them, followed by everyone over 80 and health care workers. From there, the program will be expanded as the supply increases, with the vaccine offered roughly on the basis of age groups, starting with the oldest people.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Amid the burst of optimism, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla warned governments against any immediate move to relax restrictions and reopen their economies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The time that we will have to go back to normality is not far away,\" he said. \"But it is definitely not now.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Despite the speed with which they approved the vaccine, and the intense political pressure surrounding the worldwide race to solve the crisis, British regulators insisted “no corners have been cut” during the review process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The MHRA made its recommendation after a so-called rolling review that allowed it to assess information about the vaccine as it came in, starting back in October.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The safety of the public will always come first,” said Dr. June Raine, the agency's chief executive. “And I emphasize again that this recommendation has only been given by the MHRA following the most rigorous scientific assessment of every piece of data.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Getting that message to the public will be critical if any vaccination program is to be successful. Some people are worried about getting any vaccine, never mind a new one. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“But I think once they understand and see everyone else having it without hesitation, I think you’ll find that people will go and have it,” Jacqueline Roubians, a 76-year-old retired nurse, said at Brixton Market in London. “People are dying of COVID, so you make that decision: Do you want to die or do you want the vaccine?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In addition to the huge logistical challenges of distributing the vaccines, the Pfizer-BioNTech one must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pfizer said it has developed shipping containers that use dry ice and GPS-enabled sensors will allow the company to track each shipment and ensure it stays cold.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Every country has different rules for determining when an experimental vaccine is safe and effective enough to use. China and Russia have offered different vaccines to their citizens before they had gone through large-scale, late-stage testing.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hours after Britain's announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to be outdone, ordered the start of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaign by late next week, with doctors and teachers to be first in line to receive the Sputnik V shot, whose name was inspired by the 1957 satellite that was one of Moscow's proudest technical achievements.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Russian vaccine won regulatory approval in August but has yet to complete advanced studies of its effectiveness and safety. Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said more than 100,000 people in Russia have been given the shots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still to be determined is whether the Pfizer-BioNTech shots prevent people from spreading the virus when they have no symptoms. Another question is how long protection lasts.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The vaccine also has been tested in only a small number of children, none younger than 12, and there’s no information on its effects in pregnant women.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Neergaard reported from Alexandria, Virginia.

COVID-19 relief effort Wednesday and his top Capitol Hill allies cut their demands for a $2 trillion-plus measure by more than half in hopes of breaking a monthslong logjam and delivering much-sought aid as the tempestuous congressional session speeds to a close.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden said the developing aid package \"wouldn’t be the answer, but it would be the immediate help for a lot of things.” He wants a relief bill to pass Congress now, with more aid to come next year. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden's remarks followed an announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer of New York in support of an almost $1 trillion approach as the “basis” for discussions. The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cdiv id='b29d53a8be2d4986affb78cb6311e25d' class='media-placeholder'&gt;\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\" Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan “problem solvers\" coalition.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's another sign of urgency for additional COVID aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn't as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The new plan includes a liability shield for businesses and other organizations that have reopened their doors during the pandemic. It's the first time Pelosi and Schumer have shown a willingness to consider the idea, a top priority of McConnell, though there's been no discussion on the details, which are sure to be tricky.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;McConnell had dismissed the bipartisan offer on Tuesday, instead aiming to rally Republicans around the $550 billion GOP proposal. But McConnell himself endorsed a $1 trillion-or so plan this summer, only to encounter resistance from conservatives that prompted him to retrench. He has acknowledged that another infusion of aid to states and local governments, a key Pelosi demand, probably will pass eventually.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;McConnell wouldn't respond when asked about the Democratic statement. His top deputy, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said GOP leaders might agree to merging the bipartisan proposal with McConnell's bill.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I think there's still time, although it's short, to put a bill together,\" Thune said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Any relief package would be attached to a $1.4 trillion year-end spending bill required to avert a government shutdown next weekend. Talks on that measure are proceeding but if lawmakers should stumble, a temporary spending bill would be needed as a bridge into next year.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a split-the-difference solution to the protracted impasse, hoping to speed overdue help to a hurting nation before Congress adjourns for the holidays.
