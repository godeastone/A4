But their shift to the moderates' plan comes after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., already rejected the bipartisan proposal.","\"In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\" Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement. \"Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.\"","Both parties are under intense pressure to approve further relief as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to surge across the country. Public health officials have warned the pandemic could worsen over the next several months, even as states begin to distribute the first rounds of a vaccine.","The bipartisan legislation includes $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits for 18 weeks, $288 billion in fresh funding for the Paycheck Protection small business loan program and $16 billion for testing and vaccine distribution. It also includes a temporary block on pandemic-related lawsuits to allow states to craft their own policies on legal liability.","Senate Republicans have offered their own, much smaller legislation â costing roughly over $500 billion. Their latest proposal includes $332.7 billion for small businesses, $105 billion for schools, and $31 billion for vaccine distribution, therapies and medical supplies.

The only difference of opinion that we have is, I don't want it on this bill,\" said Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a key architect of the legislation.","The massive annual bill sets policy for the Pentagon and military service members â one that, because of its size and importance, passes overwhelmingly nearly every year. It includes everything from plans on boosting troop levels and equipment to pay increases.","Inhofe said while the defense bill has some language related to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act â the target of Trump's ire â it doesn't repeal it as the president demands. And Inhofe said he told Trump that directly.","\"We just had an honest disagreement,\" Inhofe said of a recent conversation.","Trump tweeted late Tuesday that Section 230, which provides the legal protection for technology companies over content from third parties and users, was \"a serious threat to our National Security &amp; Election Integrity.\"","https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FrealDonaldTrump\u002Fstatus\u002F1333965375193624578","Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said such a repeal should involve the correct committee of jurisdiction, the Senate Commerce Committee, and not Armed Services.","\"There's a normal legislative path for doing Section 230, and a number of good ideas about how to reform it, that would be my preference,\" Thune told Capitol Hill reporters.","In a joint statement, Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the panel's top ranking Republican, noted too much is at stake with the legislation to derail efforts now.","They noted they had toiled through 2,200 provisions of the plan to reach an agreement, which addresses hazardous duty pay for servicemembers, military housing improvements and $8.4 billion in construction projects.","The House\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Farmedservices.house.gov\u002F2020\u002F7\u002Fdemocratic-led-house-passes-annual-defense-bill-for-the-60th-consecutive-year\"\u003E passed its version of the defense bill in July\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by a vote of 295 to 125.","\"For 59 straight years, the NDAA has passed because Members of Congress and Presidents of both parties have set aside their own policy objectives and partisan preferences and put the needs of our military personnel and America's security first,\" they said. \"The time has come to do that again.\"","This isn't the first time Trump has threatened to veto the defense bill. In June, he said he would \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002FHe'snot vetoing over section 230. He's just trying to use the NDA as a way to punish companies that he thinks are not pushing his propaganda.

That effort is contained in both the Senate and House versions of the bill.","Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who spearheaded that effort, says it remains in the bill. Trump previously targeted Warren specifically in his first veto threat.","She also blasted Trump's new attack on the measure, which is known as the National Defense Authorization Act.","\"He's not vetoing over Section 230,\" Warren told reporters. \"He's just trying to use the NDAA as a way to punish companies that he thinks are not pushing his propaganda.\"","Thune also noted that Senate approved the defense bill with a large majority of the chamber with Warren's provision intact. So he expects a repeat of that support once the bill is finalized.","The Senate \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.armed-services.senate.gov\u002Fpress-releases\u002Finhofe-reed-praise-senate-passage-of-national-defense-authorization-act-of-fiscal-year-2021\"\u003Eapproved the measure in July\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by a vote of 86 to 14.","\"My assumption is it would have broad bipartisan support as long as it didn't mess with that issue in some way,\" Thune said.","However, Trump remains a wildcard on whether he would sign off on plan, which could now reject his two veto demands made in recent months.","Inhofe conceded he isn't clear if Trump will back off the threats and sign the bill, or if lawmakers will have a veto-proof majority to override a possible veto.","\"I don't know that,\" Inhofe said.","Inhofe's counterpart on the Armed Services Committee, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the panel's top ranking Democrat, also notes Congress has run out of time to even debate a Section 230 repeal within the defense bill. Members from both chambers began their conference talks several weeks ago.","\"It's just too late to begin to do thorough legislation on a complex topic like this. And we have to get the bill done,\" Reed told reporters.","Inhofe wasn't alone in his confusion on the defense bill's ultimate fate this year.","If approved this month, it would mark the 60th consecutive year of passage. If not, it would break a streak that would mark a tough political failure for lawmakers.","However, some say they could also restart talks under the new administration for President-elect Biden next month if the bill fails under the Trump administration.","\"We would essentially have to come back and the new Congress, begin from scratch,\" Reed said, noting it could perhaps be done \"quickly.\"  ","\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F2020\u002F12\u002F02\u002F941509563\u002Flawmakers-barrel-ahead-on-defense-bill-plans-balking-at-trump-veto-threat\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECopyright NPR 2020.\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.google-analytics.com\u002F__utm.gif?utmac=UA-5828686-4&amp;utmdt=Lawmakers+Barrel+Ahead+On+Defense+Bill+Plans%2C+Balking+At+Trump+Veto+Threat&amp;utme=8(APIKey)9(MDAyNzUwMDI2MDEyNTA3MTU5NzcyNTQyNA004)\"\u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E"],"nprTranscriptID":0,"audio":[],"relatedLinks":[],"superTitle":null,"bylines":[{"name":"Claudia Grisales","relativeURL":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002Fpeople\u002F731633770\u002Fclaudia-grisales?ft=nprml&amp;f=940720861,940960089,941022673,941355347,941507362,941509563,941584691","id":"731633770"}],"channel":"NPR","fullChannel":null,"channelType":"","channelURL":"","id":941509563,"wordpressSlug":"","wordpressID":null,"guid":"","source":"NPR","headline":"Lawmakers Barrel Ahead On Defense Bill Plans, Balking At Trump Veto Threat","publishDate":"2020-12-02 00:00:00","updatedDate":"","relativeURL":"\u002Fnpr\u002F941509563\u002Flawmakers-barrel-ahead-on-defense-bill-plans-balking-at-trump-veto-threat","apiURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=941509563&amp;org=npr","externalURL":"","shortLink":"","miniExcerpt":"","excerpt":"President Trump threatened to veto the annual defense bill if it doesn't include a provision to end a liability shield for tech companies.

","Forty-three states and Washington, D.C., put in eviction moratoriums starting in March and April, but 27 of them ended in the spring and summer. Then in September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.federalregister.gov\u002Fdocuments\u002F2020\u002F09\u002F04\u002F2020-19654\u002Ftemporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19\"\u003E ordered a national stop to evictions\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","The CDC eviction ban isn't automatic and doesn't cover everyone.

The research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, compared numbers in the 27 states where state-level moratoriums ended with the 17 that have kept them in place. ","After controlling for factors such as stay-at-home orders, school closures and mask mandates, the researchers estimated that the lifting of moratoriums could have resulted in between 365,200 and 502,200 excess coronavirus cases and between 8,900 and 12,500 excess deaths â an average of 433,700 cases and 10,700 deaths.","\"I think whenever you see numbers like 430,000 cases, 10,000 deaths, it's surprising and it's troubling, and these are deaths that could have been prevented had the states maintained their moratoriums,\" says one of the study's lead researchers, Kathryn Leifheit of UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health.","It's worth noting that the study doesn't count actual eviction numbers, local moratoriums and rent relief in its calculations. Other variables could have influenced the uptick of coronavirus cases and deaths.","In excerpts from her interview on \u003Cem\u003EAll Things Considered\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, Leifheit discusses the study and why it was important to share the research as soon as possible.","\u003Cstrong\u003EIs what is happening here that if someone gets evicted, they might move in with family or friends and then the number of people that they're in contact with and exposed to is growing?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Yep, it's as intuitive as that, it's difficult to socially distance and shelter in place if you don't have a shelter.","\u003Cstrong\u003EDid you find data where the situations varied in interesting ways from state to state?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","So the biggest driver of cases and deaths are the [size of the] state's population, obviously, and also when they lifted the moratorium. So lifting the moratorium earlier was associated with more cases and deaths. So Texas really stands out as a state with a lot of cases and deaths associated with lifting their moratorium. I believe it's in the neighborhood of 150,000 cases and 4,500 deaths that could have been prevented by maintaining their moratorium.","\u003Cstrong\u003EDid your research look at whether different groups of people might be affected differently if this ban expires?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","We weren't able to look directly at that, but we know that Black and Latinx families are more likely to be evicted. We also know that these are the same communities that are bearing the brunt of COVID. So moratoriums can help these families remain housed and stay safe during the pandemic. And they might also keep COVID disparities from growing larger.","\u003Cstrong\u003EYour study has not been peer reviewed yet. You're getting it out early because it's urgent. This is time-sensitive information. What are you hoping the impact will be?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","The CDC moratorium is set to expire at the end of the year. That's four weeks away and it's in the setting of over a million new COVID cases a week. So state and federal policymakers need to extend these protections to make sure that families and their communities can stay safe. Individuals have a bit of a role in this, too. Tenants can understand their protections under the CDC moratorium, help their neighbors understand theirs, and then reach out for legal aid.","\u003Cstrong\u003EYou're looking at the numbers, but every one of these numbers is a real person. How did you think about that as you worked on this and wrote up your research?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","I did my Ph.D. in Baltimore and every day was in contact with people that were living in deep poverty and struggling to make rent. So I think about those faces and those people, and it really is a human tragedy and not just numbers.

Charlie Bakerâs desk.","Legislators approved the bill Tuesday, after aÂ group of six lawmakers who spent the last four months hashing out the differences between the House and Senate versions delivered the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2020\u002F12\u002FS2963.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E129-page bill\u003C\u002Fa\u003E ârelative to justice, equity and accountability in law enforcement in the Commonwealthâ late Monday afternoon.","Baker could sign the bill, veto it, or return it with amendments that the Legislature would have to consider.","In a press conference Tuesday, Baker said his office is still reviewing the bill, but praised lawmakers for making the compromise a priority in this legislative session.","Below are some of the significant ways law enforcement would change in Massachusetts if the bill becomes law:","\u003Ch2\u003ECreates New Commission To Certify Police Officers Statewide\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","The bill creates aÂ PeaceÂ Officer Standards and Training (POST) commission that will develop and implement training standards for allÂ officers in Massachusetts and have the power to investigate misconduct independently.","The commission will certify, restrict, revoke or suspend certification for officers and will have subpoena power to compel witnesses and documents as part of its investigations.Â It will also maintain a public database of officers who are decertified, suspended or are required to have retraining resulting from on-duty conduct.","The nine-member, independent commission will be appointed by the governor and attorney general. It mostly will be comprised of panelists from outside law enforcement.","The bill stipulates only three members can be from law enforcement, including a currentÂ police chief appointed by the governor. The commission would also include a retired Superior Court judge, a social worker and an attorney appointed from a list of five nominations presented by the Civil Rights and Social Justice Section Council of the Massachusetts Bar Association.","A hearings and appeals process is spelled out in the bill for officers facing decertification or discipline by the commission.","Police unions and some legislators have objected to the idea of having civilians overseeing police training and certification, fearing they do not have the needed experience as a police officer to fully understand what goes into the job.","\u003Ch2\u003EMakes Slight Changes To Qualified Immunity, And Promises A Study\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnews\u002F2020\u002F08\u002F03\u002Fqualified-immunity-police-massachusetts-overview\"\u003EQualified immunity\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &amp;mdash; a legal doctrine that provides protection to public officials, including police officers, in civil lawsuits &amp;mdash; was one of the most contentious parts of the debate around reforms. The compromise bill doesnât go as far as the earlier Senate version, which would have put the burden on public officials to make the case as to why they werenât liable in a civil suit.","The compromise bill ties qualified immunity to decertification. If a police officer is decertified by the state, he or she loses immunity. But some legal experts question the wording of the legislation, which states only officers who violate a personâs right to âbias-free policingâ and are decertified lose their qualified immunity protections.","Bias-free policing means decisions made without considering a person's race, ethnicity, sex, gender or other aspects. Many civil rights violations that are subject to lawsuits arenât about bias necessarily, but about actions like excessive force or wrongful arrest. So some lawyers doubt that this provision changes much in practice.","Advocates are also disappointed that the provision leaves in language about âthreats, intimidation and coercionâ in the state civil rights law. That makes it difficult to sue police officers for a civil rights violation unless the officer explicitly threatens, intimidates or coerces the plaintiff in some way. (For example, just punching a person excessively isnât enough, the officer would have had to explicitly threaten or intimidate the person before throwing the punch.)","\u003Ch2\u003EBans Facial Recognition, Except By The RMV\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","No public agencies could use or acquire any software that captures biometric data, including facial recognition, except the RMV. Law enforcement could get a warrant to have the RMV run a facial recognition search, but only with a warrant for violent felonies, or without a warrant in cases involving imminent danger to others.","The RMV will document and report on its website the number of searches it does on behalf of law enforcement. The proposed law also creates a commission to study the use of the technology by the Mass. Department of Transportation, which oversees the RMV.","Boston \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnews\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F23\u002Fboston-facial-recognition-ban\"\u003Ealready banned facial recognition\u003C\u002Fa\u003E this year, along with several other smaller communities.","\u003Ch2\u003EForms A Task Force To Study Body Camera Regulations\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","Body camera use across the state varies from department to department. The state public safety agency will create a task force that will propose a uniform code for the purchase and use of body cameras, requirements for storage and transfer of the recordings and discipline for not using the cameras correctly. There will be at least five public hearings on the issue.","\u003Ch2\u003EReviews The Civil Service System\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","Civil service is the system most departments use to hire and promote applicants. The bill would create a legislative commission to review the law, and recommend changes to improve diversity, transparency and representation of the community.","The civil service laws are often blamed for exacerbating the lack of diversity in hiring and promotion, and protecting those who are disciplined.

Boston officers already are restricted from shooting at moving vehicles, except when threatened with deadly force.","The legislation adds restrictions on using tear gas, rubber bullets or dogs. Officers need to have tried deescalation tactics, and the harm from the âless lethalâ option needs to be proportionate to the threat from the person or group targeted. Any use of tear gas, rubber bullets or dogs needs to be reported to the POST commission.","Before planned mass protests or demonstrations, police departments are required to âattempt in good faithâ to communicate with organizers of the event.","Police will have an explicit duty to intervene and report if a fellow officer is using unreasonable force. And police departments will have to have a policy and procedure for officers to report abuse by a colleague without fear of retaliation.","\u003Ch2\u003EInvestigates Structural Racism\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","Three special legislative commissions will look at institutional racism in jails and prisons, probation and parole.

Schools and local police departments will enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to formalize and clarify the partnership between the school and the SRO, with that MOU filed with the stateâs Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE).","The bill also forbids school department personnel and SROs from disclosing certain student record information to law enforcement officials, except in certain cases where the student, parent or guardian has provided informed written consent, or to comply with a court order or subpoena in connection with a health or safety emergency as defined by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.doe.mass.edu\u002Flawsregs\u002F603cmr23.html?section=07\"\u003EDESE regulations\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","\u003Ch2\u003EImplements Changes For State Police\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","While much of the bill has local policing in mind, it does apply to members of the Massachusetts State Police as well.

The POST commission will also oversee training at the State Police Academy in New Braintree.","The bill also includes language championed by Gov. Baker that would allow the head of the state police to be appointed from outside the agency. Current law requires the colonel be promoted from within the ranks. Critics say this practice may have contributed to a culture that has allowed for numerous scandals within the agency over the years.","Thereâs a nod to the recent state police overtime scandal, too. âKnowinglyâ submitting a false timesheet will be a crime, with a fine of three times the amount of fraudulent wages collected and up to two years behind bars.","\u003Ch2\u003EOther Notable Aspects Of The Proposed Law\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Cul class=\"spaced\"\u003E \t\u003Cli\u003ELaw enforcement officers who have sex with or indecently assault a person in custody can be charged with rape or indecent assault and battery.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E \t\u003Cli\u003ENo-knock warrants are restricted.

Over several months, an advisory group of local artists and cultural workers offered the Boston pilot program feedback to shape the application process.","A street team of young people also spread the word about the program which encouraged applicants ages 14 and up to apply. Every person involved, from those evaluating applications to the advisory panel and street team, were paid for their involvement.","By this summer, more than 300 people had applied,Â said chief of arts and culture for the City of Boston Kara Elliott-Ortega.","âIt's definitely one of my hopes that this can be a demonstration for grant-making in philanthropy,â said Elliott-Ortega. More broadly, she sees this as an investment in Boston and artists of color, and a way to think differently about how they as public institutions can interact and steward funding.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Part of their mission was to create an application process as equitable and community-driven as possible. Applicants could choose to submit their responses to a series of questions in writing or via video. RIRJ program organizers held office hours to answer questions and discuss pitches. They ask applicants to allocate a minimum of 20 percent of their project's budget to their own well-being and needs. This could be put towards rent, doctor's appointments, or whatever the recipients decided to use it for.","âYou canât be imaginative, you canât be radically imaginative if you canât take care of yourself, if you canât sustain yourself,â Elliott-Ortega continued âHow can we expect people to enter into that work without supporting that piece of it?â","This effort comes at a crucial time. Last month, Mass Cultural Council reported that cultural organizations around the Commonwealth suffered a staggering $483,519,270 in lost revenue since March, while working creatives have lost $20,138,858 in personal income. The first cohort will begin orientation this month.","âWe want to bring access to resources and support to members of the cohort for those who want and need it,â said Ceci\u003Cstrong\u003EÂ \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EMÃ©ndez-Ortiz, executive director of the Center for Art and Community Partnerships (CACP) at MassArt.","In a year of such loss where so many simply tried to survive, the goal was to amplify and uplift the work of marginalized communities across the board.","The largest grants, worth an estimated $40,000, were awarded to six artists, while ten other artists received $1,000 grants. Bashezo, co-founder of the Unbound Bodies, a queer, trans, Black, indigenous, people of color creative collective, was among those six selected for their planned installation called âRoots and Futures We Are The Ones We've Been Waiting For.â","Their concept seeks to pay homage to, in their words, the âbrilliance, magic, and wisdomâ of black, indigenous elders of color and trans and non-binary black folks by building âLiving altars.â","âI've been dreaming of this project for a while and I was really excited when I got a reminder for this grant, because honestly, I saw it and it fell out of my head given what the world was like at that time,â Bashezo said. âThe first iteration really was me going back to my collective members to be like, âI have this idea. What's our capacity like? Where are we feeling about the possibility of this? And do folks want to want to try it.â","Itâs also a way to take back a narrative often drowned out by headlines of violence against QTPOC, particularly trans women of color. Rather than lighting candles, sharing hashtags and putting up images of a person following their death, the core of this is to symbolically and literally give people their roses while theyâre living. Candles will be lit to honor this personâs joy, worth, and dignity.","âI want to know people in my community before something tragic happens,â they said. âAnd perhaps then we are more connected in a way that could circumvent some of that violence...to create these like these spectacle, these alters, these really vibrant, vivacious, moments for people to feel supported and to have a community of folks supporting them in their artistic vision of how they want to be seen or revered.â","Their plan is to create a book with images of the altar that will also include stories, recipes, music, desires, dreams and memories. Eventually, Bashezo hopes to be able to share a meal in community with the altars as installations and the opportunity for people to gather and perform.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Another $40,000 grantee, Fabiola Mendez, is a cuatro player from Puerto Rico.Â  Her project, âNegrura,â which means \"blackness\" in Spanish, will explore her own identity as she delves into conversations around race with others.","She intends to produce an audio visual project with a team of people that will consist of six episodes where they talk to the Latinx community, specifically in Bostonâs Latin Quarter. She plans to talk ask Afro-Latinx people to share and talk about their lives.","âAs a Latina myself, talking about race is not something that we feel comfortable with,\" she said. \"There are so many traumas that we have as a society and sometimes people just want to identify as Latinx folks and not as Black.â","Mendez plans to work with a local organization, Hyde Square Task Force, and have community members participate in the process of making this project.

The equipment and cameras purchased for this project will be donated to the community.","âI will be writing the music, but the people that are going to be manning the camera, writing the scripts, and doing the screen writing are going to be members of the community alongside some experienced folks that are going to train them,â she said. âI don't want to be a colonizer.

Perhaps that's true; getting sober has been a transformative process for the Boston-based singer-songwriter â one that has helped them to demystify their relationship with their faith, as well as their trans and non-binary identity. The album versions of these songs were created with producers Justine Bowe and Gabe Goodman. The collaboration not only added depth and perspective; it also helped Anjimile to create a polished showpiece that celebrates the nuances of their journey through loss and personal growth. â\u003Cem\u003EStacy Buchanan (\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wgbh.org\u002Fartsandculture\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGBH\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003E)\u003C\u002Fem\u003E","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cfigure class=\"article-fig size-large\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"size-large article-image\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.npr.org\u002Fassets\u002Fimg\u002F2020\u002F11\u002F25\u002Fwaxahatchee-saint-cloud_custom-a12771ae126821b1fd788765a15ed52847002321.jpg?s=6\"\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class=\"article-fig-caption article-fig-caption--pull\"\u003E (Merge)\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E","\u003Ch6\u003E\u003Ca id=\"waxahatchee\" class=\"anchor\"\u003E \u003C\u002Fa\u003E47.\u003C\u002Fh6\u003E","\u003Ch3\u003EWaxahatchee\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESaint Cloud\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","Plenty of musicians have faked a country drawl in order to lend weight to their singing style. Katie Crutchfield has a natural Southern accent, but, oddly enough, she spent years disguising it behind distorted guitars. After almost a decade playing in the New York and Philadelphia rock scenes, you could barely tell from her performances with Waxahatchee that she was born and raised in Alabama. But on her 2020 record, \u003Cem\u003ESaint Cloud\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, Crutchfield embraced her roots, her accent and a songwriting style that owes more to Lucinda Williams than the punk music of her youth. The collection of 11 songs isn't really rock, Americana or country.

The new perspective arrived courtesy of a 2014 career change from professional musician to coffee shop owner. Standing in one place for the first time in more than a decade, Edwards captures the thread of love that ties a life together â meeting strangers in a cafe, dogs found on the side of the road and aging childhood friendships â with a straightforward lyricism and guitars that sing but don't outshine the well-earned wisdom of her voice.

The next day, doctors put him on a ventilator.","When he woke up from his treatment, he had no memory of being intubated. He wanted to thank the more than 134 hospital workers who attended to him when he was sick with COVID-19.","But that proved to be a monumental task. Doctors and nursesâ names and contact information werenât readily available to him.","âI felt the need to say thank you for the heroic treatment, and yet the circumstances were denying me that,â Gerson says. âEvery morning I would cry in gratitude and wonder, âWhy did I survive?â And so part of my â¦ emotional recovery was to say thank you.â","To track down the people who saved his life, Gerson began with the MyChart app, which displayed the names of the doctors who ordered the more than 750 blood tests, electrocardiograms and X-Rays he underwent. The app was âa saving grace,â he says.","He also looked to his insurance companyâs explanation of benefits, which provided the first initials and last names of all the doctors who billed for his treatment.","Doctors told Gerson to express his gratitude via the hospitalâs feedback hotline. When he called, the person who picked up said they were writing his comments down to post on the walls of the hospital.","But Gerson wanted to thank each and every person who had been involved in his care, so he wrote a long letter.

ECMO adds oxygen to a patientâs blood and helps the patientâs heart work for them.","âI was just trying to recount how grateful I was that all the stars aligned â that I ended up there, that they had the equipment, that they were trying it, and that I received that cutting-edge care,â he says.","There was one doctor Gerson couldnât reach: Dr. Sydney Mehl, who saw patients until he tested positive for COVID-19 and died of the virus 61 days later, as \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fwake-up-call\u002Fthis-nyc-cardiologist-died-after-61-days-fighting-covid-19-cfa3efb22a4a\"\u003EKatie Couric recounts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","âHe treated me the very first day I was in the hospital on March 20,â Gerson says. âI read [in the Couric piece] how he was treating patients right up until the day he himself checked in on March 20. So it occurred to me that I was certainly one of the last patients that he saw, if not the last, and it underscored for me that he was working right up until the last minute.â","Since sending the letter to 116 recipients, Gerson has heard back from doctors and nurses who were overjoyed to learn of his recovery and know that they made such a difference.","âI received your letter and have never once thought any of my patients would remember us, let alone well into their recovery phase out of the [intensive care unit] and subsequently the hospital,â a physician assistant manager wrote to him. âI was pregnant in my first trimester when treating you.

Goodman wrote much of her thesis at Arecibo 30 years ago and has fond memories of the famed telescope.","The large Arecibo Observatory gave students hands-on opportunities to use a telescope, she says. Goodman used to build the radio telescopeâs receiver with coaxial cables â and calculated that the National Science Foundation was paying $40,000 per day in maintenance at the time.","âI thought, âOh my God, they're giving this know-nothing graduate student a telescope that costs $40,000 a day to operate.â â she says. âBut in the end, we found the first measurement of a magnetic field in a particular kind of region in space that's very important because it formed stars. And so that's the kind of thing that happens at Arecibo.â","The facility looked even more impressive in person than in photos, Goodman says. She used to jog and walk more than 3,000 feet around the rim of the telescope with colleagues, surrounded by jungle growing on limestone karst.","The facility resembled something out of âJurassic Parkâ more than any of the movies people may remember seeing it in, she says. And one time, Goodman hung from a rope to retrieve a pencil that had dropped into the telescope â a story she says her mother didnât enjoy hearing.","Astronomers need another telescope like Arecibo, Goodman says. Chinaâs FAST telescope attempts to do the same kind of work, but itâs yet not the same quality in terms of sensitivity and reliability, she says.","As astronomers mourn this professional loss, many will remember the telescope for its appearances in movies such as the 1997 sci-fi film âContact,â where Jodie Foster searches for alien life out in the galaxy.

Meda-Schlamel says it was something her mom immediately regretted when come October, one of her students unwittingly exposed her to the virus.","Meda died in mid-November after a three-week hospitalization where she was intubated.","The last time Meda-Schlamel saw her mom was dropping her off at an emergency room in north Dallas. Hospital staff wouldnât let Meda, who was showing symptoms, in the waiting room, so the two waited together in the hospitalâs drive thru.","âMind you, I'm watching my mother, who has given her life and service as a nurse, and she's hunched over, gasping for breath on an outdoor bench in a drive thru in front of an emergency room,â she says. âI begged them to come help her.â","When the triage nurse eventually came outside to get her mom, Meda-Schlamel says she begged to accompany her inside.

The Virgin Hyperloop test run was on a 500-meter track north of Las Vegas with a passenger pod traveling inside an enclosed tube at more than 100 mph, though it could have reached much greater speeds.Â ","Virgin Hyperloop is one of a handful of companies currently trying to build such a system for passenger travel. Sara Luchian, the companyâs director of passenger experience, was one of two people on board the test ride.Â ","âIt was exhilarating,â she says. âI mean, it was such a thrill, largely because of the psychology of the moment, just understanding the magnitude of what we were accomplishing. But of course, it was a sporty ride that was quite thrilling physically as well.âÂ ","Hyperloop technology was conceived by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk in 2012 to address the two main issues that slow down conventional freight transportation: friction and air resistance. The futuristic high-speed system is designed with passenger pods that move through a partial vacuum in steel tubes.","âSo with the Hyperloop, our vehicles, which we call pods, accelerate gradually via electric propulsion inside of this low pressure tube. It's not a perfect vacuum, but it's very close,â Luchian says. âAnd so the pod actually glides along using the magnetic levitation. It can reach very high speeds because there's no friction, a vehicle against track, and there's ultra-low aerodynamic drag.âÂ ","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","The test ride lasted a total of 15 seconds, she says. The pod reached 107 mph in six seconds, but it can reach speeds of up to 600 mph given a longer tube.Â ","âI felt the acceleration a little bit,â she says. âIt was maybe two or three times as strong as what you feel when you're taking off in a plane, but certainly not uncomfortable.âÂ ","With a longer tube, Luchian says the acceleration would be slower so that the G-forces felt would be similar to what is experienced on a conventional passenger train today.Â ","In other words, âyou'd barely feel it,â she says.Â ","The test is a major milestone for Virgin Hyperloop because they were able to demonstrate the safety of the system, Luchian says. The company also \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theverge.com\u002F2020\u002F10\u002F8\u002F21507532\u002Fvirgin-hyperloop-one-certification-center-west-virginia\"\u003Erecently announced\u003C\u002Fa\u003E its Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which puts it a step closer to having independent regulators review the system.","âThe system is designed to be inherently safer than other modes,â she explains. âIt's operating autonomously in an enclosed tube, so it's not susceptible to weather, to accidents at grade crossings or a cow on the track. It's not susceptible to human error or power outages.â","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","But there's still a lot of hurdles to clear before the company reaches the point of moving passengers and cargo at any significant scale.","âThis is the first new mode of transportation in over a century,â Luchian says. âI think one of the issues with existing modes is that they have legacy problems from the 20th century, whether it's rail, subway, air, and we are building for a 21st century solution.âÂ ","Luchian says the reason why Hyperloop is different is because it starts fresh rather than âessentially leapfrogging the technology of the last several decades.âÂ ","âWe're moving at such high speeds that we can effectively connect cities like metro stops,â she says. âIt's on demand. It's direct to destination. We can really transform economies and the way people live.âÂ ","The promise of the Hyperloop is not only to more efficiently connect major cities, but also to make rural and suburban areas more accessible, she says.Â ","The Hyperloop âwould really transform where we could live, access to affordable housing, but also to good jobs, which are increasingly in city centers,â she says. âI think the real power of the Hyperloop is demonstrated when it is a network and not just an A to B route, but of course, that will be some years ahead.â","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fjulia-corcoran\"\u003EJulia Corcoran\u003C\u002Fa\u003E produced and edited this interview for broadcast with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Ftinku-ray\"\u003ETinku Ray\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fsamantha-raphelson\"\u003ESamantha Raphelson\u003C\u002Fa\u003E adapted it for the web.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2020-11-23 12:40:00","broadcastTime":"12:40:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":false,"audioDatetime":"1606154098","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":78,"type":"category","name":"Technology","description":"","slug":"technology","series":false,"count":2653}],"audio":[{"id":94468,"createdAt":"2020-11-23 12:54:58","updatedAt":"2020-11-23 12:54:58","fileName":"hereandnow_1123_hyperloop-human-passengers","playCount":0,"airDate":"2020-11-23","source":"hereandnow","wordpressTitle":"Human Passengers Travel In A Hyperloop For The First Time","wordpressSlug":"hyperloop-human-passengers","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":555,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"Virgin Hyperloop is the first company to conduct a test of its new hyperloop technology with human passengers.","megaphoneID":"00a5bf2a-2db5-11eb-8586-0349da32f21f","megaphoneURL":"http:\u002F\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR8845135670.mp3","articleAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=642158&amp;org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Faudio\u002F94468","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":[{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":4444111,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR8845135670.mp3"},{"extension":"mp4","sizeInBytes":4444111,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Fs3.amazonaws.com\u002Faudio.wbur.org\u002F2020\u002F11\u002Fhereandnow_1123_hyperloop-human-passengers.mp4"}]}],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":642158,"type":"caption","attributes":{"id":"attachment_642235","align":"aligncenter","width":"1000","caption":"Sara Luchian (right), director of passenger experience at Virgin Hyperloop, was one of the two passengers on the first test ride earlier this month.

This is unlike the PCR test that uses a long swab called a nasopharyngeal to get deep in the nostril.","The test itself looks similar to a pregnancy test, he says. The nasal swab is placed in a small tube of liquid, he says, then a couple drops from the swab are put onto an encased piece of paper.","If a line on the paper strip appears, the test is positive. If no line shows up, the test is negative, he says.","Yielding a negative rapid test doesnât mean you donât have any trace of the coronavirus in your system, he says. What this test generally means is youâre unlikely to be infectious at that point in time.","PCR tests are still considered the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2020\u002F11\u002F10\u002Fcoronavirus-test-options\"\u003Egold standard\u003C\u002Fa\u003E because they are âexquisitely sensitive to pick up the genetic material from this virus,â potentially even weeks after a person has been infected, he says.","But PCR tests need to be sent away, meaning you could be infected as you await the results. Rapid antigen tests, he says, detect contagion right away, giving you real-time information on whether the coronavirus is live in your body.","âThe antigen test, these simple paper strip tests, pick up the actual proteins of the virus and those parts will only be there when the person has live, likely contagious virus,â he explains.","That way, Mina says you can know within minutes whether to quarantine immediately.","For the at-home tests, extra strips can be added as a backup against false positives. And if youâre asymptomatic, the test can still detect if you have enough virus to likely transmit it to others, he says.","Mina argues that rapid antigen tests need to be considered as public health tools instead of medical devices, the category PCR tests are placed in.","Since rapid antigen tests are seen as clinical diagnostic tests by the Food and Drug Administration, at-home rapid testing has been difficult to roll out. Mina says he does want rapid testing to be regulated, but for each coronavirus test to be evaluated for a specific purpose.","âWhat I would like the FDA to do is to create a new pathway to regulate tools like these rapid antigen tests for the use that they should be intended for, [which] in this case is for public health mitigation strategies,â he says.","Mina and other Harvard economists \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nber.org\u002Fpapers\u002Fw28031\"\u003Ecalculated the cost\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of starting a massive country-wide home testing program and determined it would have cost billions. However, they make the case that it would have saved a lot of money because it could have avoided lockdowns and saved lives.","âThe U.S. government can produce and pay for a full nationwide rapid antigen testing program at a minute fraction (0.05% â 0.2%) of the cost that this virus is wreaking on our economy,â Mina wrote in TIME.","The at-home system also relies on people to test themselves multiple times a week along with adhering to health safety measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing. Mina believes people would react well to an individualistic approach that âmeets people where theyâre atâ â such as letting folks test themselves in the comfort of their own home â compared to the current âtop-down, more paternalistic approachâ of COVID-19 testing.","âUnlike a mask which has become politicized in many ways, these tests take less than one minute to perform and you do that twice a week,â he says. âAnd I believe very deeply that people, even the most ardent non-mask wearers, still recognize that this is a real virus and they don't want to mistakenly give their 80-year-old parent coronavirus.â","There has been some concern that folks would let their guard down if they used at-home testing on a regular basis and received consistent negative results. Mina says the same argument â that a safety measure would backfire â was used when seat belts and pregnancy tests were invented.","Mina perceives the pandemic as a âwarâ where businesses need to come together to make at-home testing possible. While it may be expensive, â$5 billion is not expensive for a war that's literally cost us trillions,â he says.","The tools and innovation to get rapid antigen testing into the homes of millions of Americans exist in the U.S., he says. He advises getting the countryâs technology companies on board and using the Defence Production Act to increase the speed of manufacturing tests.","âThese should not even be questions if we actually consider how many Americans have died and what the economic and social toll has been on all of us,â he says.","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fkaryn-miller-medzon\"\u003EKaryn Miller-Medzon\u003C\u002Fa\u003EÂ produced and edited this interview for broadcast withÂ \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fchris-bentley\"\u003EChris Bentley\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.Â \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fserena-mcmahon\"\u003ESerena McMahon\u003C\u002Fa\u003EÂ adapted it for the web.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2020\u002F11\u002F26\u002Fnative-americans-coronavirus-dakotas","title":"Native American Leaders Act To Take COVID-19 Seriously As Cases Surge In The Great Plains","prefix":""},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2020\u002F11\u002F24\u002Futah-nurse-covid-19-hospitals","title":"Health Care Workers Strained As Hospitals Reach Capacity In Utah, New Mexico","prefix":""},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2020\u002F11\u002F18\u002Fcovid-19-double-lung-transplant","title":"Double Lung Transplant Patient With COVID-19 Describes Gasping For Air","prefix":""}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2020-11-30 13:40:00","broadcastTime":"13:40:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1606762380","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":69,"type":"category","name":"Health","description":"","slug":"health","series":false,"count":15787},{"id":5238,"type":"tag","name":"Here &amp; Now's Coronavirus Coverage","description":"All of Here &amp; Now's segments on coronavirus, in one place.","slug":"here-and-now-coronavirus","series":false,"count":1186}],"audio":[{"id":94683,"createdAt":"2020-11-30 13:53:00","updatedAt":"2020-11-30 15:03:50","fileName":"hereandnow_1130_at-home-covid-19-testing","playCount":0,"airDate":"2020-11-30","source":"hereandnow","wordpressTitle":"Cheap At-Home Tests Could End The COVID-19 Pandemic By Christmas, One Researcher Says","wordpressSlug":"at-home-covid-19-testing","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":584,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"Epidemiologist Michael Mina says there is an inexpensive rapid test you could take home a few times a week.","megaphoneID":"451c97b8-333d-11eb-b075-c779db1e0318","megaphoneURL":"http:\u002F\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR8670674371.mp3","articleAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=643596&amp;org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Faudio\u002F94683","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":[{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":4669600,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR8670674371.mp3"},{"extension":"mp4","sizeInBytes":4669600,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Fs3.amazonaws.com\u002Faudio.wbur.org\u002F2020\u002F11\u002Fhereandnow_1130_at-home-covid-19-testing.mp4"}]}],"embedMeta":null,"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2020\u002F11\u002FAP20143751078644.jpg","width":3000,"height":2000,"title":"Test swabs and specimen tubes sit on a table at a COVID-19 testing site at the Abyssinian Baptist Church  in the Harlem neighborhood of New York.

It mostly will be comprised of panelists from outside law enforcement.","The bill stipulates only three members can be from law enforcement, including a currentÂ police chief appointed by the governor. The commission would also include a retired Superior Court judge, a social worker and an attorney appointed from a list of five nominations presented by the Civil Rights and Social Justice Section Council of the Massachusetts Bar Association.","A hearings and appeals process is spelled out in the bill for officers facing decertification or discipline by the commission.","Police unions and some legislators have objected to the idea of having civilians overseeing police training and certification, fearing they do not have the needed experience as a police officer to fully understand what goes into the job.","\u003Ch2\u003EMakes Slight Changes To Qualified Immunity, And Promises A Study\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnews\u002F2020\u002F08\u002F03\u002Fqualified-immunity-police-massachusetts-overview\"\u003EQualified immunity\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &amp;mdash; a legal doctrine that provides protection to public officials, including police officers, in civil lawsuits &amp;mdash; was one of the most contentious parts of the debate around reforms. The compromise bill doesnât go as far as the earlier Senate version, which would have put the burden on public officials to make the case as to why they werenât liable in a civil suit.","The compromise bill ties qualified immunity to decertification. If a police officer is decertified by the state, he or she loses immunity. But some legal experts question the wording of the legislation, which states only officers who violate a personâs right to âbias-free policingâ and are decertified lose their qualified immunity protections.","Bias-free policing means decisions made without considering a person's race, ethnicity, sex, gender or other aspects. Many civil rights violations that are subject to lawsuits arenât about bias necessarily, but about actions like excessive force or wrongful arrest. So some lawyers doubt that this provision changes much in practice.","Advocates are also disappointed that the provision leaves in language about âthreats, intimidation and coercionâ in the state civil rights law. That makes it difficult to sue police officers for a civil rights violation unless the officer explicitly threatens, intimidates or coerces the plaintiff in some way. (For example, just punching a person excessively isnât enough, the officer would have had to explicitly threaten or intimidate the person before throwing the punch.)","\u003Ch2\u003EBans Facial Recognition, Except By The RMV\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","No public agencies could use or acquire any software that captures biometric data, including facial recognition, except the RMV. Law enforcement could get a warrant to have the RMV run a facial recognition search, but only with a warrant for violent felonies, or without a warrant in cases involving imminent danger to others.","The RMV will document and report on its website the number of searches it does on behalf of law enforcement. The proposed law also creates a commission to study the use of the technology by the Mass. Department of Transportation, which oversees the RMV.","Boston \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnews\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F23\u002Fboston-facial-recognition-ban\"\u003Ealready banned facial recognition\u003C\u002Fa\u003E this year, along with several other smaller communities.","\u003Ch2\u003EForms A Task Force To Study Body Camera Regulations\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","Body camera use across the state varies from department to department. The state public safety agency will create a task force that will propose a uniform code for the purchase and use of body cameras, requirements for storage and transfer of the recordings and discipline for not using the cameras correctly. There will be at least five public hearings on the issue.","\u003Ch2\u003EReviews The Civil Service System\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","Civil service is the system most departments use to hire and promote applicants. The bill would create a legislative commission to review the law, and recommend changes to improve diversity, transparency and representation of the community.","The civil service laws are often blamed for exacerbating the lack of diversity in hiring and promotion, and protecting those who are disciplined.

It also will review the possibility of appointing a diversity officer for every city or town with a fire or police department.","\u003Ch2\u003ECreates Stronger Use-Of-Force Policies And Rules For 'Less Lethal' Weapons\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","The bill bans chokeholds entirely, restricts officers from firing into a fleeing motor vehicle unless thereâs a risk of imminent harm and creates rules around the use of tear gas, dogs or rubber bullets.","Bostonâs policy currently \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnews\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F11\u002Fboston-police-use-of-force-policies\"\u003Eallows the use of chokeholds\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in cases where deadly force is necessary; this law would forbid them in all cases. Boston officers already are restricted from shooting at moving vehicles, except when threatened with deadly force.","The legislation adds restrictions on using tear gas, rubber bullets or dogs. Officers need to have tried deescalation tactics, and the harm from the âless lethalâ option needs to be proportionate to the threat from the person or group targeted. Any use of tear gas, rubber bullets or dogs needs to be reported to the POST commission.","Before planned mass protests or demonstrations, police departments are required to âattempt in good faithâ to communicate with organizers of the event.","Police will have an explicit duty to intervene and report if a fellow officer is using unreasonable force. And police departments will have to have a policy and procedure for officers to report abuse by a colleague without fear of retaliation.","\u003Ch2\u003EInvestigates Structural Racism\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","Three special legislative commissions will look at institutional racism in jails and prisons, probation and parole. Theyâll investigate disparities in the treatment of people of color and whether structural racism is the cause, and recommend changes.","\u003Ch2\u003ERemoves Requirement That Schools Have Officers, And Restricts Disclosure Of Student Information\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmalegislature.gov\u002FLaws\u002FGeneralLaws\u002FPartI\u002FTitleXII\u002FChapter71\u002FSection37P\"\u003ECurrent law\u003C\u002Fa\u003E mandates that every school have a School Resource Officer, often called a SRO.

Schools and local police departments will enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to formalize and clarify the partnership between the school and the SRO, with that MOU filed with the stateâs Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE).","The bill also forbids school department personnel and SROs from disclosing certain student record information to law enforcement officials, except in certain cases where the student, parent or guardian has provided informed written consent, or to comply with a court order or subpoena in connection with a health or safety emergency as defined by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.doe.mass.edu\u002Flawsregs\u002F603cmr23.html?section=07\"\u003EDESE regulations\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","\u003Ch2\u003EImplements Changes For State Police\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","While much of the bill has local policing in mind, it does apply to members of the Massachusetts State Police as well.

The POST commission will also oversee training at the State Police Academy in New Braintree.","The bill also includes language championed by Gov. Baker that would allow the head of the state police to be appointed from outside the agency. Current law requires the colonel be promoted from within the ranks. Critics say this practice may have contributed to a culture that has allowed for numerous scandals within the agency over the years.","Thereâs a nod to the recent state police overtime scandal, too. âKnowinglyâ submitting a false timesheet will be a crime, with a fine of three times the amount of fraudulent wages collected and up to two years behind bars.","\u003Ch2\u003EOther Notable Aspects Of The Proposed Law\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Cul class=\"spaced\"\u003E \t\u003Cli\u003ELaw enforcement officers who have sex with or indecently assault a person in custody can be charged with rape or indecent assault and battery.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E \t\u003Cli\u003ENo-knock warrants are restricted.

The app was âa saving grace,â he says.","He also looked to his insurance companyâs explanation of benefits, which provided the first initials and last names of all the doctors who billed for his treatment.","Doctors told Gerson to express his gratitude via the hospitalâs feedback hotline. When he called, the person who picked up said they were writing his comments down to post on the walls of the hospital.","But Gerson wanted to thank each and every person who had been involved in his care, so he wrote a long letter.
