                    <p class="bsp">Taiwan would take action to back Australians at a time when they are “under tremendous pressure,” President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said yesterday, as tensions between Australia and China heated up.
Taipei and Canberra have been mutually supportive in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in exchanging critical medical materials in the early stages, Tsai said, before chairing the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Central Standing Committee meeting in Taipei.
Taiwan and Australia are like-minded nations, sharing the common values of democracy, freedom and human rights, while their economic and trade relations have also become close, she said.
Canberra has been voicing support for Taiwan’s international participation, and Taiwanese are empathetic and supportive of Australians at a time when they are under tremendous pressure, Tsai said.
The government would deliberate the best means to let Australians feel the friendship of Taiwanese, she said.
Canberra-Beijing ties have soured after a series of trade and diplomatic disputes.
Beijing on Saturday last week started imposing import tariffs of up to 212 percent on Australian wine, accusing Australia of dumping its wine on the Chinese market.
Canberra said that it was “extremely disappointed” by the decision.
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian (趙立堅) on Monday posted on Twitter a doctored photograph showing a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloody knife to the throat of an Afghan child holding a lamb. The caption read: “Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians &amp; prisoners by Australian soldiers.”
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded that China remove the photograph and apologize for the “repugnant post,” but was rejected by Beijing.
Over the past few days, many government agencies and Internet users have shown their support for Australia by sharing photographs of Australian wine on social media.

                                                                Joshua Wong (黃之鋒), 24, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent democracy advocates, was jailed yesterday for more than 13 months over an unlawful anti-government rally last year, the toughest and most high-profile sentence for an opposition figure this year.
Wong’s sentence comes as critics say the Hong Kong government is intensifying a crackdown on the opposition and chipping away at wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed after the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, a charge authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong reject.
Reacting to the court ruling, British Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs Dominic Raab urged Hong Kong and Beijing to stop their campaigns to stifle the opposition.
Wong had pleaded guilty to organizing and inciting an unlawful assembly near police headquarters during the height of the sometimes violent demonstrations in June last year. He faced a maximum of three years in jail.
About 100 supporters gathered quietly inside the court ahead of the sentence, while a small group of pro-Beijing protesters rallied outside, calling for a hefty prison sentence.
“I know the coming days will be tougher. We will hang in there,” Wong, wearing a black sweater and mask, shouted after the sentence was read out.
“It’s not the end of the fight,” Wong said later through his lawyers. “Ahead of us is another challenging battleground. We’re now joining the battle in prison along with many brave protesters, less visible yet essential in the fight for democracy and freedom for Hong Kong.”
Wong’s colleagues — Agnes Chow (周庭), 23, and Ivan Lam (林朗彥), 26 — were jailed for 10 and seven months respectively, on charges linked to the same demonstration when thousands of protesters surrounded the police headquarters on June 21 to demand the government withdraw a now-shelved extradition bill.
Chow, who cried inside court on hearing her sentence, had pleaded guilty                            </p>

                                                                A US Congress commission to monitor US-China security and trade issues has recommended that the director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) be nominated by the US president and confirmed by the US Senate, in effect treating the post as an ambassadorial nomination.
The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in its annual report examined five key aspects of the US-China relationship, including global competition, economic and trade relations, and Taiwan and Hong Kong.
In the section on Taiwan, the commission wrote that this year was “pivotal” for cross-strait relations, citing China’s imposition of a National Security Law in Hong Kong and its intensifying military operations around Taiwan.
In economic terms, the report highlighted Taiwan’s efforts to move global supply chains away from China, as well as its decision to lift restrictions on US meat imports, which it said showed Taiwan’s commitment to reducing its economic reliance on China and forging better ties with the US.
“A growing chorus of voices in Washington policy circles are questioning whether China’s mounting aggression toward Taipei and the deepening cross-strait military imbalance necessitate a new US approach to cross-strait relations,” the report said.
Policymakers face “an increasingly urgent and difficult set of choices about responses to China’s coercion of Taiwan,” it said, adding that the steps the US government takes in the next few years would have “far-reaching consequences” for Taiwan, the region and the US.
The report contained a list of 19 policy recommendations, of which four pertained to Taiwan.
Among them, the commission called on US Congress to enact legislation to make the director of the AIT a presidential nomination subject to the advice and consent of the US Senate.
It recommended amending the US’ Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative to stipulate that the US would use its membership in international organizations to oppose any attempt                            </p>

                                Chen Shih-chung said the CECC was not considering loosening the mandatory home quarantine requirement for international arrivals                                A total of 84 healthcare facilities have been designated to provide COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that people planning on traveling abroad can pay for themselves, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said yesterday, as it reported six more imported cases.
The list of sites, as well as the examination times and fees, have been published on the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Web site.
The PCR tests cost between NT$5,000 and NT$7,000, and 37 of the facilities can provide rapid testing services, providing same-day results, the CECC said.
Fifty-seven of the facilities would provide the testing services during the Lunar New Year holiday, said Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC.
People planning to travel abroad are advised to check what documentation and formatting of the test reports are required by their destination before getting a test, he said.
Chen said the latest imported cases were three Indonesian migrant workers, a Frenchman, a Cypriot and a Taiwanese who is a permanent resident of the US.
Two Indonesian women, cases No. 681 and No. 682, arrived in Taiwan for work on Nov. 17, with one in her 40s and the other in her 20s, he said.
They tested negative during a special project on Friday last week that gave PCR tests to 939 Indonesian migrant workers housed in centralized quarantine facilities, but when tested again before their quarantine period ended on Monday their tests came back positive.
Case No. 683 is an Indonesian man in his 20s who arrived on Nov. 14 and whose company paid for him to be tested on Sunday as his stay at a quarantine hotel was ending, Chen said.
While the man had no COVID-19 symptoms, his test came back positive yesterday, he added.
Case No. 684 is a Taiwanese in his 30s who returned on Sunday last                            </p>

                                                                The US Department of Justice is investigating an alleged bribery scheme involving election campaign donations to secure a presidential pardon, a court filing showed on Tuesday.
The document, which discusses the legality of searching communications and electronic devices of individuals, including attorneys, is highly redacted, with all identifying information blacked out.
However, it refers to a “secret lobbying scheme” directed at “senior White House officials” to gain a presidential “pardon or reprieve of sentence” for an unnamed individual.
The scheme, under investigation since at least August, appears to have involved lobbyists and lawyers, a well-heeled donor to political campaigns, and a man or woman who is or was in prison and is hoping for presidential intervention.
The filing indicates that the lobbyists and lawyers contacted White House officials requesting a presidential pardon or reprieve, citing “past substantial campaign contributions” and “anticipated future substantial political contributions” from a donor.
It suggests that the donor is making the offer on behalf of the person seeking clemency.
The document does not indicate when the actions involved took place and, in the sections not redacted, there is no reference to US President Donald Trump or his campaign team
“Pardon investigation is Fake News!” Trump wrote on Twitter late on Tuesday.
The New York Times reported that Trump has discussed granting pre-emptive pardons to his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, his three oldest children — Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric — and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
There is also public discussion of Trump issuing a pardon for himself, for any crimes he might be charged with related to his time in office — though the legality of that has never been tested.
“A self-pardon would be a fitting abuse to end Trump’s presidency. It would also be corrupt, illegitimate, and void,” US Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.                            </p>

                                CPC Corp, Taiwan has what it takes to independently explore and develop fossil fuel resources abroad, the chairman of the state-run company said                                The first shipment of oil from CPC Corp, Taiwan’s (CPC, 台灣中油) oil fields in Chad arrived in Kaohsiung Port yesterday, heralded by water cannon boats. 
The fanfare was to celebrate a successful end of a long and uncertain journey by the state-run company to develop its own oil fields. 
CPC in 2006 secured the rights to explore the Oryx Oilfield from the government of Chad, and struck oil three years later. 
In 2017, it signed a 25-year license to develop the field. 
“This is the culmination of 40 years of overseas prospecting for CPC,” chairman Jerry Ou (歐嘉瑞) said at an unloading ceremony at the port. “It proves that CPC has what it takes to independently prospect and develop fossil fuel resources abroad.”
“We will replicate our success here and develop more projects that will help achieve energy independence for Taiwan,” Ou said.
Since the field started production in February, 1.4 million barrels of oil have been produced, almost a million of which arrived in Kaohsiung yesterday. 
The Oryx field is capable of producing up to 9,500 barrels per day, although it is currently producing just 5,000 barrels per day due to depressed oil prices. 
However, the celebrations have been tempered by renewed doubts over China CEFC Energy Co’s (華信能源) stake in the project. 
CPC sold half of its rights in the project to China CEFC Energy in 2016 for US$114 million as it sought to reduce its overseas investment risks.
CPC and CEFC China each own 35 percent of the field, and the Chadian government owns the rest. 
CPC spokesman Chang Ray-chung (張瑞宗) told reporters repeatedly that CPC was “in charge” of the operations, even though the Chinese company has an equal number of shares. 
“It is written into the contract that we signed with the government of Chad and CEFC China                            </p>

                                <font class="red hidden"></font>
                                                                People who travel abroad and return within three days would not have to provide a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result prior to their departure for Taiwan, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said yesterday as it reported four new imported cases.
Under the center’s autumn-winter COVID-19 prevention measures that took effect yesterday, travelers arriving in Taiwan must provide a PCR test result issued within three days of their boarding a flight to Taiwan.
The center had previously said that travelers who met three conditions could return to Taiwan without a valid PCR test result, but they would have to sign an affidavit, would be assigned special seating on their flight and have to pay for a mandatory test upon arrival.
It said on Monday that people who had difficulty obtaining a PCR test result within the three-day period could return in the same way, but their affidavit would be subject to review and they could be fined if their reasons for not having a test result was found to be unreasonable.
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), who is also the CECC spokesman, yesterday said the CECC had decided to also exempt people who leave and return to Taiwan within three days from providing a PCR test result prior to their return.
They would need to sign an affidavit, accept special seating, pay for a PCR test upon arrival and undergo mandatory home quarantine for 14 days.
CECC Border Quarantine Division deputy head Ho Li-li (何麗莉) said that as of 2pm yesterday, there were only about 150 arriving passengers on five flights, and all of them had presented a PCR test result before boarding.
The CECC does not encourage people to intentionally avoid getting a PCR test before leaving for Taiwan, as they could face a fine for contravening regulations, but                            </p>

                                            Fines range from NT$10,000 for travelers who refuse to amend an improperly filled disease survey to NT$150,000 for fabricating a test result, the CECC said                                            The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) yesterday announced four additional conditions under which travelers to Taiwan can be exempted from providing a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result before boarding a plane, and explained how fines would be imposed on those who fail to provide test results.
The center’s autumn-winter COVID-19 prevention program that went into effect on Tuesday requires all travelers to Taiwan to provide a PCR test issued within three days prior to boarding a flight.
Exemptions are granted to three special categories, which are limited to Republic of China (ROC) citizens; alien resident certificate holders; and people from China, Hong Kong and Macau with residency permits. 
The three categories are: family emergencies and medical emergencies; traveling from a country where a self-paid PCR test is unavailable; and special cases approved by the CECC.
People who have other difficulties obtaining a PCR test result can sign an affidavit to return, be assigned special seats on their flight and pay for a mandatory test upon arrival, but their reason for not having a test result on hand would be reviewed and they could be fined if the reason is found to be not good enough.
Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the center, said that the CECC has added a fourth category with four conditions. 
The fourth category is “other conditions announced by the CECC,” including people who travel abroad and return within three days; children younger than seven; people who have an overdue PCR test result (issued more than three days prior to the boarding date) due to a flight cancelation; and companions of people with family emergencies and medical emergencies.
People who meet the additional conditions can sign an affidavit for boarding and pay for a mandatory test upon arrival in Taiwan, Chen said, adding that people                                        </p>

TRA Director-General Chang Cheng-yuan (張政源) told a forum yesterday that one of the agency’s strategies involves having eight railway stations serving as regional tourism hubs, and that the plan would be implemented in two phases. 
The first phase would see the establishment of hubs in Taipei’s Nangang (南港), Taichung’s Xinwuri (新烏日), Kaohsiung’s Xinzuoying (新左營), Pingtung’s Fangliao (枋寮) and Hualien stations, while the second phase would cover Taitung, Luodong (羅東) and Keelung railway stations.
Each hub would be equipped with a VIP room, Chang said, adding that the one in Hualien is to open on Dec. 30, when the Mingri excursion train is scheduled to transport passengers to the east coast for New Year’s Eve. 
Passengers must pay to access services at VIP rooms, except those taking tourist trains, and passengers with a TRA membership would receive a discount, Chang said. 
Chang explained how the agency selected some of the regional tourism hubs. 
The Nangang Railway Station houses the TRA, high-speed rail and Taipei MRT systems, and is the center of the Taipei City Government’s east gateway project, he said, adding that the station is also the starting point of the proposed high-speed rail extension from Taipei to Yilan.
Xinwuri and Xinzuoying stations were chosen because they also house three railway systems, Chang said. 
Fangliao is the terminal station of the agency’s railway line on the west coast and the starting point of the South Link Line, he said.
It is also the starting and terminal points of blue-colored diesel commuter trains, a tourist train service, he added.
To prepare for the Year of Railway Tourism, Chang said the agency has begun upgrading antiquated facilities at the                                        </p>

                                            Families should maintain a more positive environment during mealtime, as it can affect a child’s eating habits and social development, a psychiatrist said                                            Eating disorders, including anorexia and bulimia, might have their roots in childhood, including development of poor eating habits or early trauma, a Taipei-based psychiatrist said yesterday.
A 16-year-old female high-school student who lost her father in an accident and was sent by her mother to boarding school abroad three years ago, was found to have anorexia when she came back to Taiwan about a year ago, said Chen Chia-chu (陳家駒), chief director of the department of psychiatry at Shu-tien Memorial Hospital.
The girl also had frequent crying spells, constipation and irregular periods, Chen said. 
The mother talked to her daughter and found that she was a victim of verbal bullying in school, which caused her to be excessively concerned about her weight, so she often skipped meals and only drank water.
When the mother asked the girl to keep a record of her daily food intake, she began experiencing symptoms of bulimia and anorexia, often binge eating and later regretting it, then refusing to eat, Chen said.
The mother took her daughter to Chen’s clinic to seek help. 
During consultation, he learned that the student has a close relationship with her family, but since childhood, her mother often forced her to eat food that she disliked, ordering and threatening her to “eat faster or I will take it away,” or “I’m going to be upset if you don’t eat it,” stressing her out, Chen said.
The girl developed poor eating habits from a young age as she often felt anxious during meal time, the doctor said.
Her anxiety was compounded by significant changes in her life three years ago, including the loss of her father, living abroad alone and peer pressure from classmates, causing her to develop eating disorders, he said.
People with eating disorders are more likely to be very concerned about the perceived flaws in                                        </p>

Police on Friday last week arrested Kuo, 52, who allegedly led the operation, and questioned more than 10 people in connection with the case, including Kuo’s two deputies, both surnamed Lee (李), who were released after posting bail on Tuesday, the office said.
The investigation found that Kuo’s operation, based in New Taipei City’s Jinshan District (金山), rigged bids, as well as extorted, coerced and assaulted other contractors, to win about NT$150 million (US$5.21 million at the current exchange rate) in bids related to two nuclear power plants, prosecutors said.
Kuo, his two deputies and two colluding contractors were listed as suspects in the case, and could be charged with assault, attempted murder, intimidation and extortion, as well as breaches of the Government Procurement Act (政府採購法).
Prosecutors said evidence showed that Kuo from 2016 to last year won seven projects related to the decommissioning of the Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei City’s Shihmen District (石門) and one project in 2017 at the Guosheng Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei City’s Wanli District (萬里).
Taipower Power Co (Taipower), which was responsible for the bidding process, is reported to have planned NT$150 billion in expenditures over 25 years to decommission the Jinshan plant. 
While most of the work requires advanced engineering skills, NT$30 billion has been budgeted for maintenance, material procurement, warehouse construction and other parts of the project, attracting many businesses and contractors.
The investigation found that while Kuo and his friends pooled money to register a construction company, he did not have a business license or permits for the projects, but illegally                                        </p>

                                            The bill moots a carbon levy and incentives to promote reducing emissions, while a board would oversee climate action at government agencies                                            Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Hung Sun-han (洪申翰) and civic groups yesterday introduced a draft act on climate change, urging the government to work with like-minded partners to advance climate action.
Such legislation is key to improving the nation’s global participation as well as local governance, Hung told a news conference in Taipei.
The goal is for the proposed rules to replace the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act (溫室氣體減量及管理法), which has proven to be incapable of curbing greenhouse gas emissions since its implementation in 2015, he said.
If promulgated, the bill would push the government to pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, instead of just halving the 2005 level as stipulated in the act.
It says that the government should impose a “carbon levy” and promote incentives for reducing carbon emissions.
The government should also establish a board at the Executive Yuan chaired by the premier that would oversee climate action at government agencies, the proposal says.
Record-high temperatures in Taiwan in July and water shortages that have affected agricultural irrigation highlight the urgency of a policy program that better addresses extreme weather events, Taiwan Environment and Planning Association chairman Chao Chia-wei (趙家緯) said.
The draft, which has a chapter on adaptation to climate change, promotes bottom-up and community-based action and policymaking grounded on scientific evidence, while clarifying the responsibilities of government agencies, Chao said.
The bill is not merely for environmental protection, but also to stimulate economic growth, Citizen of the Earth, Taiwan deputy executive director Tsai Chung-yueh (蔡中岳) said.
The EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism would soon come into force and US president-elect Joe Biden is likely to follow suit, Tsai said, urging the government to join the trend, especially as the nation is blocked from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

                                                                                        A group of overseas Taiwanese in Norway are taking a case on their national identity to the European Court of Human Rights — with plans to file the case in the first half of next year — after Norway’s Supreme Court rejected their appeal to change their listed nationality from “China” to “Taiwan,” Joseph Liu, a Taiwanese lawyer living in Norway, told reporters on Monday.
One of the initiators of the movement, “My Name, My Right,” Liu and his group plan to hire lawyers from the UK and France who know European law and have knowledge of Asia to represent them, he said.
The planned suit stemmed from the group’s failed attempt to force the Norwegian government to change the nationality of local Taiwanese on their local residency permits, he said.
Norway in 2010 changed the nationality on permits for Taiwanese from “Taiwan” to “China,” which was seen as an attempt to appease Beijing after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo (劉曉波) that year, Liu said.
In 2018, 10 Taiwanese students launched a fundraising campaign in Taiwan to fund their lawsuit in Norway, including the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration, and collected more than NT$3 million (US$104,290 at the current exchange rate), Liu said.
They used the funds to file cases asking that their listed nationality be changed, but the courts rejected their plea, citing the “one China” policy.
Norway has diplomatic relations with China and does not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation.
The group still has about NT$1 million that can be used for a lawsuit in the European Court of Human Rights, Liu said.
Norway is a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, which stipulates that a complainant can take a case to the European Court of Human Rights after domestic remedies have been exhausted, he said.

The rights of home-schooled students applying for university would not be negatively affected by the portfolio system, the ministry said in a statement.
The system is an initiative that the ministry has been pushing among senior-high-level students with the implementation last year of its 12-Year Basic Education Curriculum Guidelines.
One of its aims is to encourage students to begin keeping a record of their learning from their first year of senior-high school to alleviate the burden of preparing college applications in their final year.
The ministry said its statement was in response to concerns reported in the media about how home-schooled students receiving so-called “experimental education” would submit files to their online portfolios.
All students who receive an “experimental education,” including those who are home-schooled, have access to a platform and database where they can upload files, the ministry said.
They can upload the same number of files and in the same way as other students, it said.
The only difference would be the person who authenticates the learning outcomes, it said.
Their educators, who might be parents or paid teachers, would verify submissions made by home-schooled students, while students enrolled in schools would have their submissions approved by their teachers, it said.
All senior-high-level students can submit up to six learning outcomes, as well as up to 10 pieces of work, to their online academic portfolios each year in preparation for applying for university, the ministry said.
Regardless of the format of their education, their rights would not be negatively affected if they are unable to, or choose not to, use the online academic portfolio system, it said, adding that they                                        </p>

The committee said that Chunghwa Post would be given access  to the funds after it presents a special briefing on the issue.
As of July, the company had spent about NT$561 million installing iPostbox terminals across the nation, with the number of units expected to reach 2,400 by the end of this year.
With the proposed funding, the company was aiming to have 3,000 units installed by the end of next year.
However, the usage rate of iPostbox terminals has not shown significant growth, increasing from 48.8 percent in 2017 to 51.8 percent in 2018, before falling to 51.7 percent last year and to about 30 percent this year, prompting calls from lawmakers across party lines to either eliminate or freeze the funding.
Democratic Progressive Party legislators Ho Hsin-chun (何欣純) and Lin Chun-hsien (林俊憲) said the company faces strong competition from convenience stores, which most people use to send and receive packages.
Chunghwa Post should figure out ways to compete with convenience stores and conduct a comprehensive assessment of the service, otherwise it would be simply burning cash without reaching its goals, they said.
Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Legislator Lu Ming-che (魯明哲) said that the company should at least try to elevate the usage rate before considering expanding the number of iPostbox units.
Chunghwa Post chairman Wu Hong-mo (吳宏謀) said that iPostbox has an advantage in terms of reverse logistics management, allowing people to easily return products.
To boost the usage rate of the service, the company has been offering discounts for sending and receiving                                        </p>

Although CTi News filed an injunction at the Taiwan High Administrative Court after the commission on Nov. 18 denied its license renewal application, the NCC said that its ruling remains effective as long as it is not canceled by itself or the court.
The nation’s largest multiple system operator, China Network Systems Co (CNS), had applied to replace CTi News with Global News, and Dafeng TV Ltd applied to have CNN take channel 52, NCC Vice Chairman Wong Po-tsung (翁柏宗) said.
Hulien and Tongtai applied to leave channel 52 vacant for now, Wong said.
Kbro Co has yet to submit an application for changes to the channel lineup, he said.
The commission has yet to deliberate on the applications, he said.
NCC specialist Huang Juei-di (黃睿迪) said that cable system operators are required to apply to change their business plans before Friday next week, when CTi News’ license expires.
“The Satellite Broadcasting Act (衛星廣播電視法) states that cable operators must also inform their subscribers about the channel lineup change by running a news ticker about it for five consecutive days before they officially take down the channel,” Huang said.
“Given that it would take some time for the commission to deliberate and approve the applications for a channel lineup change, we would allow them to start running news tickers before their applications are approved this time, and they would not be considered to be breaking the law even if they do not air news tickers for exactly five days,” he said.
By law, cable TV operators are not supposed to broadcast CTi News after 12am                                        </p>

                            The bank would act if it noticed currency speculation, the governor said, but he did not comment on a likely trajectory of the NT dollar against the greenback                            The central bank would intervene in the market whenever necessary to help stabilize the New Taiwan dollar, central bank Governor Yang Chin-long (楊金龍) said yesterday, adding that it is concerned Taiwan might be placed on the US watchlist for currency manipulation.
The Control Yuan recently sent letter inquiring about the central bank’s market regulation efforts, Yang told a meeting of the legislature’s Finance Committee on the NT dollar’s appreciation and property price hikes.
“It is the central bank’s top responsibility to stabilize foreign exchanges,” he said.
The central bank has often stepped in toward the end of trading sessions to moderate the NT dollar’s appreciation against the US dollar. 
The NT dollar had as of yesterday picked up 3.32 percent against the greenback this year and has on several occasions temporarily surpassed the NT$28.5 defense threshold allegedly set by Yang’s predecessor, Perng Fai-nan (彭淮南).
The central bank has to take action when noticing currency speculation and disorderly fund movements, Yang said.
The governor declined to comment on reports that the NT dollar might next year rise to NT$27.5, but said that global investment banks have mixed views about the US dollar’s outlook. 
Taiwan is likely to be added to the US watch list after meeting two criteria: having a trade surplus with the US of at least US$20 billion and a current account surplus of more than 2 percent of GDP, Yang said.
The US normally updates its currency list twice a year, in April and October, but has not released a list so far this year, Yang said, adding that the central bank would try to communicate with the US on the matter.
Yang warned against loose real-estate lending, saying that the government would continue its coordinated efforts to thwart property speculation without affecting real-estate demand.
The endeavor is in the initial stage, but further measures might                        </p>

                                                        Qualcomm Inc expects global shipments of 5G smartphones to more than double to between 450 million and 550 million units next year from this year, driven by increasing 5G network deployment worldwide and broader adoption of 5G technology beyond smartphones, a company executive told a virtual news conference yesterday.
The San Diego-based company said that more than five times more telecoms have commercially launched 5G services in the first 18 months of the 5G era, compared with wireless technology transitions to previous generations.
The momentum is to pick up speed in 2022, with the shipment volume of 5G-ready smartphones projected to reach 750 million units, Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon told reporters following the release of the company’s latest flagship 5G chip, Snapdragon 888.
To address the growing market, Qualcomm would build a broad product portfolio of end devices at prices between US$250 and US$1,000, the company said.
There are more than 700 5G designs that have thus far been launched or are under development based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips, Amon said. 
A majority of them supports the sub-6 gigahertz band, he said, adding that Qualcomm’s strength goes beyond millimeter Wave (mmWave) technology.
Qualcomm is positive for the deployment of mmWave networks, as 5G technology is getting more broadly adopted in Japan, with more mmWave-based services to be offered next year, Amon said.
Qualcomm also has high hopes that China would build mmWave networks for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, he said.
Asked whether Qualcomm might be able to resume shipping 5G chips to Chinese customers, as US president-elect Joe Biden might take a more rational stance in the US-China trade dispute, Amon did not directly answer.
Chipsets have been driving 5G growth in China, and that would likely continue, he said.
Qualcomm’s business model of forging cooperation with Chinese customers creates more business opportunities, Amon said.

                                                        The nation’s green bond issuance is expected to set a record of NT$56.6 billion (US$1.97 billion) this year, up 12 percent from NT$50.2 billion last year, as companies took advantage of lower interest rates to raise funds, Taipei Exchange (TPEX) data showed.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) yesterday issued NT$12 billion of green bonds in three tranches, the first for the world’s largest contract chipmaker, boosting the nation’s cumulative green bond issuance to NT$53.6 billion this year to date, the data showed.
TSMC has said it would use the proceeds to cover its capital expenditure for green buildings and other projects aimed at environmental improvement.
The coupon rates of TSMC’s green bonds hover between 0.4 and 0.48 percent, lower than the rates of 0.5 to 0.67 percent for the corporate bonds it issued earlier this year, TPEX data showed.
TSMC’s green bonds were the third-largest issuance so far this year, following Orsted Wind Power TW Holding A/S’ green bonds valued at NT$15 billion and Taiwan Power Corp’s (Taipower, 台電) green bonds valued at NT$12.8 billion, the data showed.
HSBC Bank Taiwan Ltd (匯豐台灣商銀) yesterday said it would issue NT$3 billion of five-year green bonds with a coupon rate of 0.4 percent on the TPEX on Dec. 25, adding that the bonds would rank first in terms of size among all green bonds issued by financial firms.
The bank’s issuance would raise the nation’s cumulative green bond issuance to NT$56.6 billion, which would be a new record for a single year, the data showed.
HSBC Taiwan, which has been focusing on financing offshore wind projects, would use the proceeds to finance the projects and other green loans, the bank’s head of global markets Ruby Ho (何汝平) told the Taipei Times by telephone yesterday.
Although the bank could also use deposits as financial resources, issuing long-term bonds with fixed                        </p>

                                                        On Tuesday, the New Power Party (NPP) held a news conference at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei to outline its position on a series of proposed constitutional amendments in anticipation of the newly formed Constitutional Amendment Committee meeting in the next legislative session. NPP Legislator Chiu Hsien-chih (邱顯智), who is to sit on the committee, took part in the news conference.
The NPP legislators said that they hoped the committee would deliberate lowering the voting age to 18, abolishing the Examination Yuan and Control Yuan, putting the final nail in the coffin of the Taiwan Provincial Government, removing wording related to unification with China in the Constitution, lowering the threshold for constitutional amendment proposals and implementing a mixed-member proportional representation system to make it easier for smaller political parties to participate.
The respective arguments for and against these proposals aside, what was remarkable was the objective and clear exposition of the ideas, including details of how they were to be executed, the reasons they are desirable and the vision for the betterment of the nation they entail.
The NPP legislators had no need to berate the efforts of the government or any other party, and the proposals are to a degree aligned with the positions of the two main parties, the Democratic Progressive Party and the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT).
There is the potential for consensus beyond partisan politics, the entrenched blue/green divide and opposition for opposition’s sake that have been such a frustrating, hackneyed, boring part of Taiwanese politics for decades, and which are deleterious to the national interest.
That is in stark contrast to the scenes of lawmakers chucking pig guts and squelching offal into the legislative chamber carpet on Friday last week, courtesy of the leadership of KMT Chairman Johnny Chiang (江啟臣), who occasionally offers glimmers that he might actually change the                        </p>

                                                        Universities and colleges are bearing the brunt of Taiwan’s falling birthrate. Many schools have already closed down, while lower-ranking institutions find themselves in a precarious position. 
The Ministry of Education has said that more than 40 private senior-high schools, universities and colleges are already in a critical situation. 
When schools are forced to close, the impact is felt not just by students, who can easily transfer to other schools, but even more so by teachers and other staff, for whom it is hard to change track in the middle of their careers.
A Cabinet meeting on Nov. 19 approved a draft law on the disbandment of private schools at the senior-high school level and above. 
The law would establish norms for the rights and interests of the staff and students of such schools if they close down. It would establish a closing-down fund to subsidize students’ remedial instruction, accommodation and transport expenses, as well as bridge the gap for staff salaries, insurance and other expenses.
However, the ministry, in response to the industrial trends resulting from the restructuring of the US’ technology supply chain, is moving ahead with plans to establish colleges of semiconductor technology at four public schools: National Taiwan University, National Chiao Tung University, National Tsing Hua University and National Cheng Kung University. 
By helping public universities attract more students while the shortage of students is pushing private schools into crisis, the ministry is kicking a person when they are down and further degrading private schools’ image in the eyes of the public.
To get through these difficult times, private schools are without exception trying to increase their revenue and cut their spending. In the past, China and other countries provided supplementary sources of students, but the supply has since been cut off by worsening cross-strait relations and the COVID-19 pandemic.                        </p>

                                                        Now that US president-elect Joe Biden is preparing to take the reins of a new administration, the question written across everyone’s fevered brow is what stance will he take with China. Given that the US’ previous Indo-Pacific strategy was devised during a Democratic administration prior to Biden’s presidency, and now that the “War on Terror” has been put to bed and the US is pursuing a shift back to Asia and strengthening its relations with allies, it is going to lock horns with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the process of ensconcing itself in regional alliances. This is going to be the main fulcrum of the US’ China policy.
As many countries in the Indo-Pacific region rely heavily on China economically, even though they have close relations with the US for military security, they are still reluctant to distance themselves from China too much, by words or actions. As a result, the world would continue to see tensions played out on the international stage between the US and China in terms of competition and decoupling of the semiconductor supply chain. 
Many countries in the Indo-Pacific region, which have opted for free trade, would maintain a high degree of flexibility, and would try to mediate between the two sides, with their different systems and different leaders. Even if the US remains central to their way forward, they would still, to one degree or another, also need to keep one eye on China’s rise.
The CCP’s strategy for turning China into a global power follows three strands: It wants to see the country become a technology powerhouse, a maritime power and a major trading nation. It already ranks No. 1 in the world in the output of more than 220 kinds of industrial products.

                            Hailed by Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, 19-year-old Curtis Jones scored the only goal, while Caoimhin Kelleher kept a clean sheet against Ajax                            Juergen Klopp hailed a depleted Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Ajax to reach the last 16 as one of his greatest UEFA Champions League nights given the Reds’ lengthy injury list.
The Liverpool youngsters took their chance to shine as 19-year-old Curtis Jones scored the only goal, while goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher kept a clean sheet against the Dutch side on his European debut.
The win ensures that Klopp’s players win Group D with a game to spare, allowing some of his stars to get a much-needed rest away at Midtjylland next week.
“Honestly, since I am [at] Liverpool, for how it feels, one of the biggest Champions League nights,” said Klopp, who has guided Liverpool to two finals and won the competition last year. “It was the most important, the most difficult and the most exceptional game.”
Kelleher had to deputize for Alisson Becker, who was added to the Reds’ injury list before the game’s start — along with Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita, Xherdan Shaqiri, Trent Alexander-Arnold and James Milner — while Andrew Robertson needed heavy strapping applied to his ankle in the first half.
“There are not a lot of reasons to smile — because of the injuries, it’s tricky. Then, the boys throw themselves into that game,” Klopp added.
“How the kids played: Robbo with a proper knock on the ankle, pushing himself through; Hendo [Jordan Henderson] with a proper knock on the back, pushing himself through; Gini [Wijnaldum], I have no words for him; Curtis Jones, what a game for a 19-year-old boy,” Klopp said. “I’m really proud tonight.”
Jones has been one of the beneficiaries of those absentees with many more first-team minutes this season and came closest to breaking the deadlock before halftime, when his curling effort came back off the post after just six minutes.

Holyfield’s challenge comes after 54-year-old Tyson on Saturday last week dominated Roy Jones Jr, 51, in an exhibition fight in Los Angeles that was ruled a draw.
Calling the bout with Jones Jr “a tune-up,” Holyfield taunted Tyson, urging him to give the world the fight that they want to see.
“No more excuses,” Holyfield said in a statement. “This is the fight that must happen for both our legacies. Saturday night, you said you were ready to fight me, so sign the contract and get in the ring, Tyson.”
“The world is waiting and it’s on you now — I’m ready,” Holyfield added.
In their prime, Tyson and Holyfield, who is now 58, were two of boxing’s biggest draws.
They met twice with Holyfield winning the first fight in an 11th-round TKO, while the second ended in controversy when Tyson was disqualified for biting a chunk out of his opponent’s ear.
When Tyson said earlier this year that he was getting ready to return to the ring for a charity exhibition bout, Holyfield put his hand up, but the promoters opted for Jones instead.
“My side tried to make the fight happen and we got nothing but excuses,” Holyfield said. “Now I can see why he wanted a tune-up fight before thinking about fighting me. Roy Jones was a good local opponent for Mike, but a fight with me would be a global event and the only fight that anyone wants to see is a fight between us.”
“There is absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t make it happen,” Holyfield said.                                    </p>

All ITTF events were canceled starting in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and world rankings were frozen in April, but tournament play resumed last month with the Women’s World Cup, the Men’s World Cup and the ITTF Finals.
Lin and Cheng reached the quarter-finals in the World Cup and ITTF Finals, helping to maintain their rankings.

Taiwanese veteran Chuang Chih-yuan was ranked 26th, up four places from the previous rankings, while Chen Chien-an was 69th, down one spot.
In the women’s rankings, China’s Chen Meng retained the top spot, while China’s Sun Yingsha climbed to second, ahead of Japan’s Ito Mima, who fell to third.
China’s Wang Manyu, Ding Ning and Zhu Yuling were ranked fourth, fifth and sixth respectively.
Taiwan’s Chen Szu-yu, who last month reached the quarter-finals of the Women’s World Cup, moved up one place to 25th.                                    </p>

Kopay is a 78-year-old former NFL running back living in Palm Springs, California, and known as the first professional athlete to reveal that he was gay. He came out in 1975 after his NFL career ended.
In 1995, Roberts became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first professional rugby player to come out as gay.
About 45 years after Kopay’s open disclosure, and 25 after Roberts’, the men are united in their disappointment that a higher proportion of gay athletes have not come out.
Kopay’s eight-year NFL career spanned five teams, beginning with the San Francisco 49ers in 1964.
“It’s horrible to hear that kids are being targeted. I’ve sacrificed so much to try and change this problem,” Kopay added.
Roberts, who has forged an acting career since retiring, played for two more rugby league seasons after coming out. A powerful front-row forward who played for the Australia national team, Roberts wishes he had done it sooner.
“It was the worst-kept secret. Everyone knew I was gay. I wish I had come out from Day 1,” the 55-year-old Roberts said from a movie set near Sydney. “It is kind of empowering when you come out. People came to me and said how happy they were for me.”
Kopay’s comments about homophobic language and Roberts’ about coming out as gay are at the forefront of two studies published yesterday by Melbourne’s Monash University.
The first analyzed survey responses from 1,173 lesbian, gay and bisexual people aged 15 to 21 and living in the US, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland.
The authors described it as the first study to investigate whether                                    </p>

                        The Chang’e 5 spacecraft is to collect 2kg of samples from the lunar surface as well as from 2m deep in a previously unexplored area called Ocean of Storms                        A Chinese space probe yesterday began drilling on the surface of the moon hours after landing, in an ambitious attempt to bring back the first lunar samples in four decades.
Beijing has poured billions into its military-run space program, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022 and of eventually sending humans to the moon.
The Chang’e 5 spacecraft — named for the mythical Chinese moon goddess — touched down on the near side of the moon on Tuesday, and is gathering samples from the surface, the China National Space Administration said.
Chang’e 5’s goal is to collect lunar rocks and soil to help scientists learn about the moon’s origins, formation and volcanic activity.
If the return journey is successful, China would be only the third country to have retrieved samples from the moon, following the US and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.
This is the first such attempt since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976.
State media yesterday described the mission as “one of China’s most complicated and challenging space missions so far.”
The probe had finished drilling for samples by the morning and is “gathering surface samples as planned,” the space agency said.
The probe was launched from China’s southern Hainan Province last week and entered lunar orbit on Saturday after a 112-hour journey.
State broadcaster China Central Television showed rows of scientists at mission control, wearing blue jackets emblazoned with Chinese flags, monitoring the probe then clapping after it successfully touched down.
A huge screen at the front of the room displayed images sent by the probe of the gray lunar surface.
The spacecraft plans to collect 2kg of material in a previously unexplored area known as Oceanus Procellarum — or “Ocean of Storms” — a vast lava plain, according to the science journal Nature.

                                                A sexual harassment case against a powerful Chinese media figure yesterday began in Beijing, with his accuser calling it a major moment in the country’s still-young #MeToo movement.
Zhou Xiaoxuan, 27, known in China by the nickname Xianzi (弦子), sparked a social media storm in 2018 after accusing prominent television host Zhu Jun (朱軍) of groping and forcibly kissing her when she was an intern at state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV).
China’s first-ever civil code — passed in May — expanded the definition of sexual harassment, but many women are still reluctant to come forward and it is rare for cases like this to make it to court.
“I’m very nervous,” she told reporters ahead of the hearing. “But whether we win or lose the case, it has meaning.” 
“If we lose, it allows the questions we raised at least to remain in history. Someone will have to give us an answer,” she added.
Zhou said she found herself alone in a dressing room with Zhu in 2014, and that he groped her after asking if she wanted to continue to work for the channel after her internship.
Zhu is a former host of the country’s annual Spring Festival Gala — one of the world’s most-watched television shows — and other major broadcast events.
He has denied the allegations and launched his own court case accusing her of damaging his reputation.
There were about 100 Zhou supporters outside the court yesterday, some holding banners reading “#MeToo” and “We oppose sexual harassment.”
One supporter, Lucy Lu, told reporters: “No matter what happens, we think she is very brave.”
Zhou broke down in tears as she addressed her supporters ahead of the trial, telling them: “We may be joyous or we may run into setbacks. But please don’t take my setbacks to heart... We have to believe that even if                    </p>

                        <font class="red hidden"></font>
                                                More than 150 parliamentarians from 18 countries have called on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam (林鄭月娥) to intervene to ensure justice for 12 people, the youngest of whom is 16, who have been detained in mainland China after trying to flee the territory by boat.
The 12, who had all faced charges in Hong Kong linked to anti-government protests, have been held virtually incommunicado in a mainland prison since they were detained at sea on Aug. 23, apparently while trying to reach Taiwan.
Chinese authorities last week said that members of the group face charges of illegal border crossing and organizing an illicit border crossing, which could carry a sentence of up to seven years in jail.
“In your role as Chief Executive, it is incumbent on you to intercede on behalf of these young people to ensure that they are guaranteed justice,” the parliamentarians said in the letter released late on Tuesday. “To continue to fail to do so would be a gross abdication of your responsibility to serve the people of Hong Kong and ensure their well-being and safety.”
The 12 should be returned to Hong Kong immediately, be allowed to nominate legal representatives and given access to their families, they said in the letter.
Lam has said the 12 would have to face justice in the mainland and that her government would provide them with “needed and feasible” assistance.
Human rights groups and democracy advocates have expressed fear over the conditions and treatment of the 12, with families and lawyers for them denied access.                    </p>

                                                        Sasadre is a born performer. The energetic septuagenarian from the Aboriginal Paiwan community dandyishly presents himself with a scarf tastefully tied around his neck and a laurel adorning his crown — made from a plant I’m too distracted by his schtick to ask the name of. We are in the mountains of Taitung County, and Sasadre has been tasked to teach us about his community’s traditional slate houses and agricultural practices. He does so with panache.
For the 60 minutes we are at the settlement, Sasadre variously scolds our party for using a hunter’s knife incorrectly, encourages us to dig up peanuts, instructs us on the proper way to scare birds with tin cans and gifts us amulets. While in a field perpendicular to the house, he comically berates a photographer for stamping through his sweet potato plants. As a light rain begins to fall, he redirects us back to the slate house. 
“You are all getting away without doing any real work today,” he quips in Mandarin, feigning disappointment that the weaved baskets he had handed out earlier are returning empty.
Perimetering the back of the slate house is a low stone wall, now wet and slippery, and as Sasadre helps us over it and onto the compound proper, he offers the women a large leaf picked from a taro plant that abuts the wall. 
“It’s an umbrella,” he exclaims, and picks one for himself. 
Moments later, back in the semi-darkness of the slate house, Sasadre discusses the uses of millet and Formosan quinoa drying within, all while continuing to hold the “umbrella” over his head, his calloused fingers dancing it back and forth with every point. I couldn’t get enough. 
Sasadre’s intoxicating antics and expositions of his community’s traditions, think of it as a cross between vaudeville and Max Weber,                        </p>

                                                        Over the past few years, Taiwan’s Aboriginal communities have begun to take enormous pride in their cuisine, which is based on their unique culinary traditions, sourced from the mountains, plains and sea. 
If you are in Chihshang Township (池上), Taitung County, be sure to visit Bayang (芭洋Amis美饌), a menu-less restaurant that serves up sublime seasonal Amis cuisine. The restaurant’s owner, Kao Hsiao-yuan (高筱媛), is a sixth generation descendant of the Kakupa royal family. Kao returned to her ancestral home, which is located next to the restaurant, to care for her sick mother and research Amis culinary traditions. Bayang is the fruit of years of study, combining traditions of her mother and community, but finished with a flair of the modern.
The restaurant space, nestled off a lane of dense foliage, features ultra-high ceilings, handmade bamboo fixtures and bar, oversized wooden tables and chairs, and, like the food served, combines tradition with innovation. 
Our meal began with a robust traditional Amis seasonal soup with an assortment of wild mountain vegetables, followed by a mugao mustard salad with crushed peanut powder. Mugao is a fiddlehead fern that is important to the traditional Amis diet, and its delicate flavor wasn’t overpowered by the mustard greens. It was a nice accompaniment to the rich soup. 
The soup and salad appetizer was followed by grilled pork belly served with a side of warrior beans and onion salad with plum vinaigrette. This showstopping combination had our table gobbling down the finger-sized morsels of succulent meat topped with the refreshing sweet and sour salad. Kao says the idea of the dish came from a story about the sourcing of ingredients when her ancestors migrated from Pingtung County’s Hengchun (恆春) to Chihshang 200 years ago. 
Village-style grilled fish followed the pork. This Amis specialty is white fish grilled over                        </p>

                                                        With a chill finally in the air, the Taichung Christmas Charity Bazaar is set to kick off Saturday at the Dakeng Community Center. 
Children’s activities, including a visit by Santa Claus, will highlight the family-friendly festival, located in the hillside outskirts of the city. There will also be ample food and drink as well as live music by popular local bands.
“We’re trying to create a fun Western atmosphere,” Casper Willemse, one of the event organizers and co-owner of Three Giants Brewing Company, said.
The musical lineup starts at 1pm and will feature nine acts, including local favorites Shaun Armstrong, Brahm Gawden, Lauren Leach, Catharine Brown and Annie &amp; Taco. 
Food and drink options will include goodies from Three Giants brewery, Sausage Shack, Delicatesses Desmarais, The Braai Guy and Nick’s Samosas. In all, 19 food vendors and artisan craft stalls will be on hand. 
Funds raised from entry fees and raffles will go toward two local animal welfare groups: Taichung Universal Animal Protection Association (台中市世界聯合保護動物協會) and Gougoushan (狗狗山).
With the arrival of colder temperatures, animal shelters are in need of more resources to help improve living conditions, especially for older dogs, Willemse said. 
Home to popular hiking trails, Dakeng is located about 30 minutes from downtown Taichung. Public transportation to the festival is available by a number of buses, which run regularly between Taichung and Dakeng.                        </p>

A:  Yes, you have to rummage through a load of old tat, but occasionally you might find something really unexpected.
B:  I’m always on the look-out for vintage Italian leather boots, hoping that the store owner wasn’t aware of how valuable they were.
A:  You could be waiting a long time. I think the owners have an eye for valuable items, or get somebody to evaluate them before they put a price on it.
B:  You can always live in hope. Look, there’s a charity store over there. You might be able to pick up something unexpected and cheap there. And if you buy something, the money will go to charity.
B:  我很喜歡到古董店去好好逛一逛，尤其是到了新的地方。
A:  對呀，你得要仔細過濾一大堆舊的便宜貨，可是有時候會發現完全意想不到的東西。
B:  我一直注意在找有年代的義大利皮靴，希望店家不知道它多有價值。
A:  這樣你可能會等很久。我想店家很識貨，或是會先請人估價以後才標上價格。
B:  你可以永遠抱著希望啊。你看，那邊有一家慈善二手店。說不定可以找到一些意想不到而且便宜的東西。而且買東西的錢，會給慈善機構。

B:  Were they selling it? Are you sure somebody hadn’t just dumped a lot of unwanted possessions on the sidewalk?
A:  It was difficult to tell. I remember there was a portrait of an elderly gentleman. That might have meant something to somebody, but it was hardly a work of art. Why would anyone buy a portrait of a stranger?
B:  I think I guessed right. It must have been somebody’s discarded belongings.

A:  這很難說。我記得其中有一張老人的畫像。這畫像可能對某人來說有意義，但是幾乎稱不上是藝術。不會有人要買一張陌生人的畫像吧？

                                                        The 2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards, known as “MAMA,” the K-pop industry’s biggest annual music awards show, is returning to South Korea again for the first time in 11 years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s MAMA will be held online with no live audience on Sunday. Hosted by actor Song Joong-ki, the show will feature top K-pop acts such as BTS and Twice.
Originally, boyband Wanna One, which rose from the second season of Mnet’s reality show Produce 101 series, was expected to stage a reunion performance at MAMA. After the court revealed last month the names of trainees who were excluded from the group due to a vote-manipulation scandal, the TV channel confirmed that the group, which disbanded in January last year, will not appear at the event.
The show will also be broadcast live in Taiwan by friDay, an online video platform of Far EasTone Telecommunications Co. According to friDay, its live broadcast of a k-pop concert on Nov. 21 successfully attracted nearly 800,000 viewers, boosting its music download services by 60 percent.
(Eddy Chang, Taipei Times)
二○二○「Mnet亞洲音樂頒獎典禮」（簡稱MAMA），是韓流界的年度盛事，在睽違十一年後首次重返南韓。受武漢肺炎（新冠病毒，COVID-19）影響，MAMA將在本週日以無現場觀眾的方式線上直播。節目將由人氣男神宋仲基主持，表演陣容則包括韓流天團防彈少年團（BTS）和Twice等多組豪華卡司。
之前傳聞指出，自選秀節目「Produce 101」第二季脫穎而出的夯團Wanna One，有可能在頒獎典禮上合體開唱。不過韓國的法院稍早在上個月，公開了因該節目的作票醜聞而被排除在男團外的訓練生名字，隨後該頻道即宣布這個去年一月解散的團體將不會在MAMA現身。
在台灣，遠傳電信旗下的friDay影音平台也將轉播該節目。而根據friDay表示，該平台於十一月二十一日所轉播的另一場韓流演唱會，成功吸引了近八十萬人次收看，同時音樂下載服務亦暴增百分之六十。
